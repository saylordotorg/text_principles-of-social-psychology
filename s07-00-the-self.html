        <h3 class="title">“Dancing Matt Harding” Dances Around the World</h3>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch04_n01_p01">Matthew “Matt” Harding (born September 27, 1976) is an American video game developer who became an Internet celebrity as a result of his viral videos that show him dancing in front of landmarks and street scenes in cities around the world.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch04_n01_p02">Matt began his career working for a video game store and as an editor for a video game magazine. He then became a video game software developer but eventually became frustrated with the work of creating video games. He quit his job and began traveling.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch04_n01_p03">While he was traveling in Vietnam, he had his traveling companion video him as he danced in a city. The video was uploaded to YouTube. Matt then made a second video, a sequence of 15 dance scenes in other countries, each accompanied by background music. This video eventually became viral, getting over 20,000 hits a day as it was discovered around the world.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch04_n01_p04">Harding released his third dancing video, the result of 14 months of traveling in 42 countries, on June 20, 2008.</p>

Because an understanding of the self is so important, it has been studied for many years by psychologists (James, 1890; Mead, 1934)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn04_001">James, W.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch04_p03">In this chapter, we will first consider the cognitive aspects of the self, focusing on the <em class="emphasis">self-concept</em> (the thoughts that we hold about ourselves) and <em class="emphasis">self-awareness</em> (the extent to which we are currently fixing our attention on our own self-concept). Then we will move on to the role of affect, considering <em class="emphasis">self-esteem</em> (the positive or negative feelings that we have about ourselves) and the many ways that we try to gain positive self-esteem. Finally, we will consider the social aspects of the self, including how we present ourselves to others in order to portray a positive self-image, as well as the many ways that our thoughts and feelings about ourselves are determined by our relationships with others.</p>
