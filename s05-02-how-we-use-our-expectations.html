    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_p01">Once we have developed a set of schemas and attitudes, we naturally use that information to help us judge and respond to others. Our expectations help us think about, size up, and make sense of individuals, groups of people, and the relationships among people. If we have learned, for example, that someone is friendly and interested in us, we are likely to approach them; if we have learned that they are threatening or unlikable, we will be more likely to withdraw. And if we believe that a person has committed a crime, we may process new information in a manner that helps convince us that our judgment was correct. In this section, we will consider how we use our stored knowledge to come to accurate (and sometimes inaccurate) conclusions about our social worlds. <a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_t01">Table 2.1 "How Expectations Influence Our Social Cognition"</a> summarizes the concepts that we will discuss, some of the many ways that our existing schemas and attitudes influence how we respond to the information around us.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Automatic Versus Controlled Cognition</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p01">A good part of both cognition and social cognition is spontaneous or automatic. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Automatic cognition</a><span class="glossdef">Thinking that occurs out of our awareness, quickly, and without taking much effort.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">thinking that occurs out of our awareness, quickly, and without taking much effort</em> (Ferguson &amp; Bargh, 2003; Ferguson, Hassin, &amp; Bargh, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_031">Ferguson, M. J., &amp; Bargh, J. A. (2003). The constructive nature of automatic evaluation. In J. Musch &amp; K. C. Klauer (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">The psychology of evaluation: Affective processes in cognition and emotion</em> (pp. 169–188). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers; Ferguson, M. J., Hassin, R., &amp; Bargh, J. A. (2008). Implicit motivation: Past, present, and future. In J. Y. Shah &amp; W. L. Gardner (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Handbook of motivation science</em> (pp. 150–166). New York, NY: Guilford Press.</span> The things that we do most frequently tend to become more automatic each time we do them, until they reach a level where they don’t really require us to think about them very much. Most of us can ride a bike and operate a television remote control in an automatic way. Even though it took some work to do these things when we were first learning them, it just doesn’t take much effort anymore. And because we spend a lot of time making judgments about others, many of these judgments (and particularly those about people we don’t know very well and who don’t matter much to us) are made automatically (Willis &amp; Todorov, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_032">Willis, J., &amp; Todorov, A. (2006). First impressions: Making up your mind after a 100-Ms exposure to a face. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science, 17</em>(7), 592–598.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p02">Because automatic thinking occurs outside of our conscious awareness, we frequently have no idea that it is occurring and influencing our judgments or behaviors. You might remember a time when you came back from your classes, opened the door to your dorm room, and 30 seconds later couldn’t remember where you had put your keys! You know that you must have used the keys to get in, and you know you must have put them somewhere, but you simply don’t remember a thing about it. Because many of our everyday judgments and behaviors are performed “on automatic,” we may not always be aware that they are occurring or influencing us.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p03">It is of course a good thing that many things operate automatically because it would be a real pain to have to think about them all the time. If you couldn’t drive a car automatically, you wouldn’t be able to talk to the other people riding with you or listen to the radio at the same time—you’d have to be putting most of your attention into driving. On the other hand, relying on our snap judgments about Bianca—that she’s likely to be expressive, for instance—can be erroneous. Sometimes we need to—and should—go beyond automatic cognition and consider people more carefully. <em class="emphasis">When we deliberately size up and think about something—for instance another person</em>—we call it thoughtful cognition or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">controlled cognition</a><span class="glossdef">Deliberate, effortful thinking about a topic.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p04">Although you might think that controlled cognition would be more common and that automatic thinking would be less likely, that is not always the case. The problem is that thinking takes effort and time, and we often don’t have too much of those things available. As a result, we frequently rely on automatic cognition, and these processes—acting outside of our awareness—have a big effect on our behaviors. In the following Research Focus, we will consider an example of a study that uses a common social cognitive procedure known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">priming</a><span class="glossdef">The technique of temporarily bringing information into memory through exposure to situational events.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">a technique in which information is temporarily brought into memory through exposure to situational events</em>—and that shows that priming can influence judgments entirely out of awareness.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Research Focus</h3>
            <p class="simpara">Behavioral Effects of Priming</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p15">In one demonstration of how automatic cognition can influence our behaviors without us being aware of them, John Bargh and his colleagues (Bargh, Chen, &amp; Burrows, 1996)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_033">Bargh, J. A., Chen, M., &amp; Burrows, L. (1996). Automaticity of social behavior: Direct effects of trait construct and stereotype activation on action. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71</em>(2), 230–244.</span> conducted two studies, each with the exact same procedure. In the experiments, they showed college students sets of five scrambled words. The students were to unscramble the five words in each set to make a sentence. Furthermore, for half of the research participants, the words were related to the stereotype of the elderly. These participants saw words such as “in Florida retired live people” and “bingo man the forgetful plays.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p16">The other half of the research participants also made sentences but did so out of words that had nothing to do with the elderly stereotype. The purpose of this task was to prime (activate) the schema of elderly people in memory for some of the participants but not for others.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p17">The experimenters then assessed whether the priming of elderly stereotypes would have any effect on the students’ behavior—and indeed it did. When each research participant had gathered all his or her belongings, thinking that the experiment was over, the experimenter thanked him or her for participating and gave directions to the closest elevator. Then, without the participant knowing it, the experimenters recorded the amount of time that the participant spent walking from the doorway of the experimental room toward the elevator. As you can see in the following figure, the same results were found in both experiments—the participants who had made sentences using words related to the elderly stereotype took on the behaviors of the elderly—they walked significantly more slowly (in fact, about 12% more slowly across the two studies) as they left the experimental room.</p>

                <p class="para">In two separate experiments, Bargh, Chen, and Borroughs (1996)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_034">Bargh, J. A., Chen, M., &amp; Burrows, L. (1996). Automaticity of social behavior: Direct effects of trait construct and stereotype activation on action. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71</em>(2), 230–244.</span> found that students who had been exposed to words related to the elderly stereotype walked more slowly than those who had been exposed to more neutral words.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p18">To determine if these priming effects occurred out of the conscious awareness of the participants, Bargh and his colleagues asked a third group of students to complete the priming task and then to indicate whether they thought the words they had used to make the sentences had any relationship to each other or could possibly have influenced their behavior in any way. These students had no awareness of the possibility that the words might have been related to the elderly or could have influenced their behavior.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p05">The point of these experiments, and many others like them, is clear—it is quite possible that our judgments and behaviors are influenced by our social situations, and this influence may be entirely outside of our conscious awareness. To return again to Bianca, it is even possible that we notice her nationality and that our beliefs about Italians influence our responses to her, even though we have no idea that they are doing so and really believe that they have not. It is in this way that our stereotypes may have their insidious effects, and it is exactly these processes that may have led to a mistaken eyewitness account in the case of Rickie Johnson.</p>

    <div class="section" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Salience and Accessibility Determine Which Expectations We Use</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_p01">We each have a large number of schemas that we might bring to bear on any type of judgment we might make. When thinking about Bianca, for instance, we might focus on her nationality, her gender, her physical attractiveness, her intelligence, or any of many other possible features. And we will react to Bianca differently depending on which schemas we use. Schema activation is determined both by characteristics of the person we are judging—the <em class="emphasis">salience</em> of the characteristics—and by the current activation of the schema in the individual—the <em class="emphasis">cognitive accessibility</em> of the schema.</p>
        <div class="section" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Salience</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p01">One determinant of which schemas are likely to be used in social judgment is the extent to which we attend to particular features of the person or situation that we are responding to. We are more likely to judge people on the basis of characteristics that are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">salient</a><span class="glossdef">Attracting attention—for instance, things that are unique, negative, colorful, bright, or moving.</span></span>, meaning that <em class="emphasis">they attract our attention when we see something or someone with them</em>. Things that are unusual, negative, colorful, bright, and moving are more salient and thus more likely to be attended to than are things that do not have these characteristics (McArthur &amp; Post, 1977; Taylor &amp; Fiske, 1978).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_035">McArthur, L. Z., &amp; Post, D. L. (1977). Figural emphasis and person perception. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 13</em>(6), 520–535; Taylor, S. E., &amp; Fiske, S. T. (1978). Salience, attention and attribution: Top of the head phenomena. <em class="emphasis">Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 11,</em> 249–288.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p02">We are more likely to initially judge people on the basis of their sex, race, age, and physical attractiveness, rather than on, say, their religious orientation or their political beliefs, in part because these features are so salient when we see them (Brewer, 1988).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_036">Brewer, M. B. (1988). A dual process model of impression formation. In T. K. Srull &amp; R. S. Wyer (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Advances in social cognition</em> (Vol. 1, pp. 1–36). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.</span> Another thing that makes something particularly salient is its infrequency or unusualness. Because Bianca is from Italy and very few other people in our school are, that characteristic is something that we notice—it is salient, and we are therefore likely to attend to it. That she is also a woman is—at least in this context—less salient.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p03">The salience of the stimuli in our social worlds may sometimes lead us to make judgments on the basis of information that is actually less informative than is other less salient information. Imagine, for instance, that you wanted to buy a new music player for yourself. You’ve been trying to decide whether to get the iPod or the Zune. You went online and checked out <em class="emphasis">Consumer Reports</em>, and you found that although the players differed on many dimensions, including price, battery life, ability to share music, and so forth, the Zune was nevertheless rated significantly higher by the owners than was the iPod. As a result, you decide to go purchase one the next day. That night, however, you go to a party, and a friend of yours shows you her iPod. You check it out, and it seems really great. You tell her that you were thinking of buying a Zune, and she tells you that you are crazy. She says she knows someone who had one and had a lot of problems—it didn’t download music right, the battery went out right after it went out of warranty, and so forth—and that she would never buy one. Would you still buy the Zune, or would you switch your plans?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p04">If you think about this question logically, the information that you just got from your friend isn’t really all that important—you now know the opinions of one more person, but that can’t really change the overall consumer ratings of the two machines very much. On the other hand, the information your friend gives you and the chance to use her iPod are highly salient. The information is right there in front of you, in your hand, whereas the statistical information from <em class="emphasis">Consumer Reports</em> is only in the form of a table that you saw on your computer. The outcome in cases such as this is that people frequently ignore the less salient, but more important, information, such as <em class="emphasis">the likelihood that events occur across a large population</em>—these statistics are known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">base rates</a><span class="glossdef">The likelihood that events occur across a large population.</span></span>—in favor of the actually less important, but nevertheless more salient, information.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p05">Another case in which we ignore base-rate information occurs when we use the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">representativeness heuristic</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency to base our judgments on information that seems to represent, or match, what we expect will happen while ignoring more informative base-rate information.</span></span> (remember that <em class="emphasis">heuristic</em> refers to a simplifying strategy that we use to make judgments). The representativeness heuristic occurs when we <em class="emphasis">base our judgments on information that seems to represent, or match, what we expect will happen while ignoring more informative base-rate information</em>. Consider, for instance, the following puzzle. Let’s say that you went to a hospital, and you checked the records of the babies that were born today (<a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_t01">Table 2.2 "Using the Representativeness Heuristic"</a>). Which pattern of births do you think that you are most likely to find?</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p06">Most people think that list B is more likely, probably because list B looks more random and thus matches (is “representative of”) our ideas about randomness. But statisticians know that any pattern of four girls and four boys is equally likely and thus that List B is no more likely than List A. The problem is that we have an image of what randomness should be, which doesn’t always match what is rationally the case. Similarly, people who see a coin that comes up heads five times in a row will frequently predict (and perhaps even bet!) that tails will be next—it just seems like it has to be. But mathematically, this erroneous expectation (known as the gambler’s fallacy) is simply not true: The base-rate likelihood of any single coin flip being tails is only 50%, regardless of how many times it has come up heads in the past.</p>

Why? Because the description (“short, shy, and writes poetry”) just seems so representative or stereotypical of our expectations about Chinese people. But the base rates tell us something completely different, which might make us wary. For one, because I am a psychology professor, it’s much more likely that I know more psychology professors than Chinese professors. And at least on my campus, the number of professors in the psychology department is much bigger than the number of professors of Chinese. Although base rates suggest that “psychology” would be the right answer, the use of the representative heuristic might lead us (probably incorrectly) to guess “Chinese” instead.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Cognitive Accessibility</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s02_p01">Although which characteristics we use to think about objects or people is determined in part by the salience of their characteristics (our perceptions are influenced by our social situation), individual differences in the person who is doing the judging are also important (our perceptions are influenced by person variables). People vary in the schemas that they find important to use when judging others and when thinking about themselves. One way to consider this importance is in terms of the <em class="emphasis">cognitive accessibility</em> of the schema. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cognitive accessibility</a><span class="glossdef">The extent to which knowledge is activated in memory and thus likely to be used in perception.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">the extent to which a schema is activated in memory and thus likely to be used in information processing</em>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s02_p02">You probably know people who are golf nuts (or maybe tennis or some other sport nuts). All they can talk about is golf. For them, we would say that golf is a highly accessible construct. Because they love golf, it is important to their self-concept; they set many of their goals in terms of the sport, and they tend to think about things and people in terms of it (“if he plays golf, he must be a good person!”). Other people have highly accessible schemas about eating healthy food, exercising, environmental issues, or really good coffee, for instance. In short, when a schema is accessible, we are likely to use it to make judgments of ourselves and others.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s02_p03">Although accessibility can be considered a person variable (a given idea is more highly accessible for some people than for others), accessibility can also be influenced by situational factors. When we have recently or frequently thought about a given topic, that topic becomes more accessible and is likely to influence our judgments. This is in fact the explanation for the results of the priming study you read about earlier—people walked slower because the concept of elderly had been primed and thus was currently highly accessible for them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s02_p04">Because we rely so heavily on our schemas and attitudes—and particularly on those that are salient and accessible—we can sometimes be overly influenced by them. Imagine, for instance, that I asked you to close your eyes and determine whether there are more words in the English language that begin with the letter <em class="emphasis">R</em> or that have the letter <em class="emphasis">R</em> as the third letter. You would probably try to solve this problem by thinking of words that have each of the characteristics. It turns out that most people think there are more words that begin with <em class="emphasis">R</em>, even though there are in fact more words that have <em class="emphasis">R</em> as the third letter.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s02_p05">You can see that this error can occur as a result of cognitive accessibility. To answer the question, we naturally try to think of all the words that we know that begin with <em class="emphasis">R</em> and that have <em class="emphasis">R</em> in the third position. The problem is that when we do that, it is much easier to retrieve the former than the latter, because we store words by their first, not by their third, letter. We may also think that our friends are nice people because we see them primarily when they are around us (their friends). And the traffic might seem worse in our own neighborhood than we think it is in other places, in part because nearby traffic jams are more accessible for us than are traffic jams that occur somewhere else. And do you think it is more likely that you will be killed in a plane crash or in a car crash? Many people fear the former, even though the latter is much more likely: Your chances of being involved in an aircraft accident are about 1 in 11 million, whereas your chances of being killed in an automobile accident are 1 in 5,000—over 50,000 people are killed on U.S. highways every year. In this case, the problem is that plane crashes, which are highly salient, are more easily retrieved from our memory than are car crashes, which are less extreme.</p>

If so, the availability heuristic can lead to errors in judgments.</p>

When stimuli are highly accessible, they can be quickly attended to and processed, and they therefore have a large influence on our perceptions. This influence is due, in part, to the fact that our body reacts positively to information that we can process quickly, and we use this positive response as a basis of judgment (Reber, Winkielman, &amp; Schwarz, 1998; Winkielman &amp; Cacioppo, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_039">Reber, R., Winkielman, P., &amp; Schwarz, N.

The participants who had an easy time listing examples of their behavior (because they only had to list 6 instances) judged that they did in fact have the characteristics they were asked about (either assertive or unassertive), in comparison with the participants who had a harder time doing the task (because they had to list 12 instances).

Counterfactual thinking has even been observed on juries—people who are asked to award monetary damages to others who had been in an accident offered them substantially more in compensation if they were almost not injured than they did if the accident did not seem close to not occurring (Miller, Turnbull, &amp; McFarland, 1988).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_053">Miller, D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s04_p05">Again, the moral of the story is clear—our thinking is frequently influenced by processes that we are not aware of and that may lead us to make judgments that seem reasonable but are objectively inaccurate. In the case of counterfactual thinking, the cognitive accessibility of the potential alternative outcome leads to some very paradoxical effects.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s05_p01">In some cases, we may be aware of the danger of acting on our expectations and attempt to adjust for them. Perhaps you have been in a situation where you are beginning a course with a new professor and you know that a good friend of yours does not like him. You may be thinking that you want to go beyond your negative expectation and prevent this knowledge from biasing your judgment. However, the accessibility of the initial information frequently prevents this adjustment from occurring—leading us to <em class="emphasis">anchor on the initial construct and not adjust sufficiently</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s05_p04">They found that students who saw the first problem gave an estimated answer of about 512, whereas the students who saw the second problem estimated about 2,250. Tversky and Kahneman argued that the students couldn’t solve the whole problem in their head, so they did the first few multiplications and then used the outcome of this preliminary calculation as their starting point, or anchor. Then the participants used their starting estimate to find an answer that sounded plausible. In both cases, the estimates were too low relative to the true value of the product (which is 40,320)—but the first set of guesses were even lower because they started from a lower anchor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s05_p05">Of course, savvy marketers have long used the anchoring phenomenon to help them. You might not be surprised to hear that people are more likely to buy more products when they are listed as four for $1.00 than when they are listed as $0.25 each (leading people to anchor on the four and perhaps adjust only a bit away) and when a sign says “buy a dozen” rather than “buy one.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s05_p06">And it is no accident that a car salesperson always starts negotiating with a high price and then works down.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s06_p01">Still another potential judgmental bias, and one that has powerful and often negative effects on our judgments, is the tendency to be overconfident in our own skills, abilities, and judgments. We often have little awareness of our own limitations, leading us to act as if we are more certain about things than we should be, particularly on tasks that are difficult. Adams and Adams (1960)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_055">Adams, P. A., &amp; Adams, J. K. (1960). Confidence in the recognition and reproduction of words difficult to spell. <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Psychology, 73</em>, 544–552.</span> found that for words that were difficult to spell, people were correct in spelling them only about 80% of the time, even though they indicated that they were “100% certain” that they were correct.

Some participants made predictions about a fellow student whom they had just met and interviewed, and others made predictions about their roommates. In both cases, participants reported their confidence in each prediction, and accuracy was determined by the responses of the target persons themselves. The results were clear: Regardless of whether they judged a stranger or a roommate, the students consistently overestimated the accuracy of their own predictions (<a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s06_f01" xrefstyle="select:label">Figure 2.5</a>).</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Importance of Cognitive Biases in Everyday Life</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s07_p01">Perhaps you are thinking that the use of heuristics and the tendency to be influenced by salience and accessibility don’t seem that important—who really cares if we buy an iPod when the Zune is better, or if we think there are more words that begin with the letter <em class="emphasis">R</em> than there actually are? These aren’t big problems in the overall scheme of things. But it turns out that what seem perhaps to be pretty small errors and biases on the surface can have profound consequences for people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s07_p02">For one, if the errors occur for a lot of people, they can really add up. Why would so many people continue to buy lottery tickets or to gamble their money in casinos when the likelihood of them ever winning is so low? One possibility, of course, is the representative heuristic—people ignore the low base rates of winning and focus their attention on the salient likelihood of winning a huge prize. And the belief in astrology, which all scientific evidence suggests is not accurate, is probably driven in part by the salience of the occasions when the predictions do occur—when a horoscope is correct (which it will of course be sometimes), the correct prediction is highly salient and may allow people to maintain the (overall false) belief.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s07_p03">People may also take more care to prepare for unlikely events than for more likely ones because the unlikely ones are more salient or accessible. For instance, people may think that they are more likely to die from a terrorist attack or as the result of a homicide than they are from diabetes, stroke, or tuberculosis. But the odds are much greater of dying from the health problems than from the terrorism or homicide. Because people don’t accurately calibrate their behaviors to match the true potential risks, the individual and societal costs are quite large (Slovic, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_061">Slovic, P. (Ed.). (2000). <em class="emphasis">The perception of risk</em>. London, England: Earthscan Publications.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s07_p04">Salience and accessibility also color how we perceive our social worlds, which may have a big influence on our behavior. For instance, people who watch a lot of violent television shows also tend to view the world as more dangerous in comparison to those who watch less violent TV (Doob &amp; Macdonald, 1979).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_062">Doob, A. N., &amp; Macdonald, G. E. (1979). Television viewing and fear of victimization: Is the relationship causal? <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37</em>(2), 170–179.</span> This follows from the idea that our judgments are based on the accessibility of relevant constructs. We also overestimate our contribution to joint projects (Ross &amp; Sicoly, 1979),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_063">Ross, M., &amp; Sicoly, F. (1979). Egocentric biases in availability and attribution. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37</em>(3), 322–336.</span> perhaps in part because our own contributions are so obvious and salient, whereas the contributions of others are much less so. And the use of cognitive heuristics can even affect our views about global warming. Joireman, Barnes, Truelove, and Duell (2010)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_064">Joireman, J., Barnes Truelove, H., &amp; Duell, B. (2010). Effect of outdoor temperature, heat primes and anchoring on belief in global warming. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Environmental Psychology, 30</em>(4), 358–367.</span> found that people were more likely to believe in the existence of global warming when they were asked about it on hotter rather than colder days and when they had first been primed with words relating to heat. Thus the principles of salience and accessibility, because they are such an important part of our social judgments, can create a series of biases that can make a difference.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s07_p05">Research has found that even people who should know better—and who need to know better—are subject to cognitive biases. Economists, stock traders, managers, lawyers, and even doctors have been found to make the same kinds of mistakes in their professional activities that people make in their everyday lives (Byrne &amp; McEleney, 2000; Gilovich, Griffin, &amp; Kahneman, 2002; Hilton, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_065">Byrne, R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s07_p06">Although biases are common, they are not impossible to control, and psychologists and other scientists are working to help people make better decisions. One possibility is to provide people with better feedback. Weather forecasters, for instance, are quite accurate in their decisions, in part because they are able to learn from the clear feedback that they get about the accuracy of their predictions. Other research has found that accessibility biases can be reduced by leading people to consider multiple alternatives rather than focusing only on the most obvious ones, and particularly by leading people to think about exactly the opposite possible outcomes than the ones they are expecting (Hirt, Kardes, &amp; Markman, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_068">Hirt, E.

In fact, more than 100 people who were convicted prior to the existence of forensic DNA have now been exonerated by DNA tests, and more than 75% of these people were victims of mistaken eyewitness identification (Wells, Memon, &amp; Penrod, 2006; Fisher, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_071">Wells, G.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p20">The judgments of eyewitnesses are often incorrect, and there is only a small correlation between how accurate and how confident an eyewitness is. Witnesses are frequently overconfident, and one who claims to be absolutely certain about his or her identification is not much more likely to be accurate than one who appears much less sure, making it almost impossible to determine whether a particular witness is accurate or not (Wells &amp; Olson, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_072">Wells, G.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p21">To accurately remember a person or an event at a later time, we must be able to accurately see and store the information in the first place, keep it in memory over time, and then accurately retrieve it later. But the social situation can influence any of these processes, causing errors and biases.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p22">In terms of initial encoding of the memory, crimes normally occur quickly, often in situations that are accompanied by a lot of stress, distraction, and arousal. Typically, the eyewitness gets only a brief glimpse of the person committing the crime, and this may be under poor lighting conditions and from far away. And the eyewitness may not always focus on the most important aspects of the scene. Weapons are highly salient, and if a weapon is present during the crime, the eyewitness may focus on the weapon, which would draw his or her attention away from the individual committing the crime (Steblay, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_073">Steblay, N. M. (1997). Social influence in eyewitness recall: A meta-analytic review of lineup instruction effects. <em class="emphasis">Law and Human Behavior, 21</em>(3), 283–297.</span> In one relevant study, Loftus, Loftus, and Messo (1987)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_074">Loftus, E.

By tracking eye movements, the researchers determined that people were more likely to look at the gun than at the checkbook and that this reduced their ability to accurately identify the criminal in a lineup that was given later.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p23">People may be particularly inaccurate when they are asked to identify members of a race other than their own (Brigham, Bennett, Meissner, &amp; Mitchell, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_075">Brigham, J.

Each of the students made a purchase, and the researchers came in later to ask the clerks to identify photos of the shoppers. Results showed that the White, Black, and Mexican American clerks demonstrated the own-race bias: They were all more accurate at identifying customers belonging to their own racial or ethnic group than they were at identifying people from other groups. There seems to be some truth to the adage that “They all look alike”—at least if an individual is looking at someone who is not of his or her race.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p24">Even if information gets encoded properly, memories may become distorted over time. For one thing, people might discuss what they saw with other people, or they might read information relating to it from other bystanders or in the media. Such postevent information can distort the original memories such that the witnesses are no longer sure what the real information is and what was provided later. The problem is that the new, inaccurate information is highly cognitively accessible, whereas the older information is much less so. Even describing a face makes it more difficult to recognize the face later (Dodson, Johnson, &amp; Schooler, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_077">Dodson, C. S., Johnson, M.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p27">The situation is particularly problematic when the eyewitnesses are children, because research has found that children are more likely to make incorrect identifications than are adults (Pozzulo &amp; Lindsay, 1998)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_080">Pozzulo, J. D., &amp; Lindsay, R. C. L. (1998).

(2003). Children’s face recognition memory: More evidence for the cross-race effect. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology, 88</em>(4), 760–763.</span> In many cases, when sex abuse charges have been filed against babysitters, teachers, religious officials, and family members, the children are the only source of evidence. The likelihood that children are not accurately remembering the events that have occurred to them creates substantial problems for the legal system.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p28">Another setting in which eyewitnesses may be inaccurate is when they try to identify suspects from mug shots or lineups. A lineup generally includes the suspect and five to seven other innocent people (the fillers), and the eyewitness must pick out the true perpetrator. The problem is that eyewitnesses typically feel pressured to pick a suspect out of the lineup, which increases the likelihood that they will mistakenly pick someone (rather than no one) as the suspect.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p29">Research has attempted to better understand how people remember and potentially misremember the scenes of and people involved in crimes and to attempt to improve how the legal system makes use of eyewitness testimony. In many states, efforts are being made to better inform judges, juries, and lawyers about how inaccurate eyewitness testimony can be. Guidelines have also been proposed to help ensure that child witnesses are questioned in a nonbiasing way (Poole &amp; Lamb, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_082">Poole, D. A., &amp; Lamb, M. E. (1998). <em class="emphasis">The development of interview protocols</em>. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.</span> Steps can also be taken to ensure that lineups yield more accurate eyewitness identifications. Lineups are more fair when the fillers resemble the suspect, when the interviewer makes it clear that the suspect might or might not be present (Steblay, Dysart, Fulero, &amp; Lindsay, 2001),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_083">Steblay, N., Dysart, J., Fulero, S., &amp; Lindsay, R. C. L. (2001).

And several recent studies have found that witnesses who make accurate identifications from a lineup reach their decision faster than do witnesses who make mistaken identifications, suggesting that authorities must take into consideration not only the response but how fast it is given (Dunning &amp; Perretta, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_084">Dunning, D., &amp; Perretta, S.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p30">In addition to distorting our memories for events that have actually occurred, misinformation may lead us to falsely remember information that never occurred. Loftus and her colleagues asked parents to provide them with descriptions of events that did (e.g., moving to a new house) and did not (e.g., being lost in a shopping mall) happen to their children. Then (without telling the children which events were real or made-up) the researchers asked the children to imagine both types of events. The children were instructed to “think real hard” about whether the events had occurred (Ceci, Huffman, Smith, &amp; Loftus, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_085">Ceci, S.

Repeatedly thinking about a non-event: Source misattributions among preschoolers. <em class="emphasis">Consciousness and Cognition: An International Journal, 3</em>(3–4), 388–407.</span> More than half of the children generated stories regarding at least one of the made-up events, and they remained insistent that the events did in fact occur even when told by the researcher that they could not possibly have occurred (Loftus &amp; Pickrell, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_086">Loftus, E.

The formation of false memories. <em class="emphasis">Psychiatric Annals, 25</em>(12), 720–725.</span> Even college students are susceptible to manipulations that make events that did not actually occur seem as if they did (Mazzoni, Loftus, &amp; Kirsch, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_087">Mazzoni, G.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p31">The ease with which memories can be created or implanted is particularly problematic when the events to be recalled have important consequences. Therapists often argue that patients may repress memories of traumatic events they experienced as children, such as childhood sexual abuse, and then recover the events years later as the therapist leads them to recall the information—for instance, by using dream interpretation and hypnosis (Brown, Scheflin, &amp; Hammond, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_088">Brown, D., Scheflin, A. W., &amp; Hammond, D. C. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Memory, trauma treatment, and the law</em>. New York, NY: Norton.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p32">But other researchers argue that painful memories such as sexual abuse are usually very well remembered, that few memories are actually repressed, and that even if they are, it is virtually impossible for patients to accurately retrieve them years later (McNally, Bryant, &amp; Ehlers, 2003; Pope, Poliakoff, Parker, Boynes, &amp; Hudson, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_089">McNally, R. J., Bryant, R. A., &amp; Ehlers, A. (2003). Does early psychological intervention promote recovery from posttraumatic stress? <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 4</em>(2), 45–79; Pope, H. G., Jr., Poliakoff, M.

Findings from a survey of historical literature. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Medicine: A Journal of Research in Psychiatry and the Allied Sciences, 37</em>(2), 225–233.</span> These researchers have argued that the procedures used by the therapists to “retrieve” the memories are more likely to actually implant false memories, leading the patients to erroneously recall events that did not actually occur. Because hundreds of people have been accused, and even imprisoned, on the basis of claims about “recovered memory” of child sexual abuse, the accuracy of these memories has important societal implications. Many psychologists now believe that most of these claims of recovered memories are due to implanted, rather than real, memories (Loftus &amp; Ketcham, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_090">Loftus, E. F., &amp; Ketcham, K. (1994). <em class="emphasis">The myth of repressed memory: False memories and allegations of sexual abuse</em> (1st ed.). New York, NY: St. Martin’s Press.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s07_p07">Taken together, then, the problems of eyewitness testimony represent another example of how social cognition—the processes that we use to size up and remember other people—may be influenced, sometimes in a way that creates inaccurate perceptions, by the operation of salience, cognitive accessibility, and other information-processing biases.</p>

                <li>We use our schemas and attitudes to help us judge and respond to others. In many cases, this is appropriate, but our expectations can also lead to biases in our judgments of ourselves and others.</li>
                <li>A good part of our social cognition is spontaneous or automatic, operating without much thought or effort. On the other hand, when we have the time and the motivation to think about things carefully, we may engage in thoughtful, controlled cognition.</li>
                <li>Which expectations we use to judge others is based on both the situational salience of the things we are judging and the cognitive accessibility of our own schemas and attitudes.</li>
                <li>Variations in the accessibility of schemas lead to biases such as the availability heuristic, the representativeness heuristic, the false consensus bias, and biases caused by counterfactual thinking.</li>
                <li>The potential biases that are the result of everyday social cognition can have important consequences, both for us in our everyday lives but even for people who make important decisions affecting many other people. Although biases are common, they are not impossible to control, and psychologists and other scientists are working to help people make better decisions.</li>
                <li>The operation of cognitive biases, including the potential for new information to distort information already in memory, can help explain the tendency for eyewitnesses to be overconfident and frequently inaccurate in their recollections of what occurred at crime scenes.</li>
