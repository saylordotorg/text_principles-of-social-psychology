    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_p01">No matter how healthy and happy we are in our everyday lives, there are going to be times when we experience stress, depression, and anxiety. Some of these experiences will be major and some will be minor, and some of us will experience these emotions more than others. Sometimes these feelings will be the result of clear difficulties that pose direct threats to us: We or those we care about may be ill or injured; we may lose our job or have academic difficulties. At other times, these feelings may seem to develop for no apparent reason.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_p02">Although it is not possible to prevent the experience of negative emotions entirely (in fact, given their importance in helping us understand and respond to threats, we would not really want to if we could), we can nevertheless learn to respond to and cope with them in the most productive possible ways. We do not need to throw up our hands in despair when things go wrong—rather, we can bring our personal and social resources to bear to help us. We have at our disposal many techniques that we can use to help us deal with negative emotions.</p>
    <div class="section" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">What Doesn’t Work: Distorting and Suppressing Negative Outcomes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p01">Perhaps the most common approach to dealing with negative affect is to attempt to suppress, avoid, or deny it. You probably know people who seem to you to be stressed, depressed, or anxious but who cannot or will not see it in themselves. Perhaps you tried to talk to them about it, to get them to open up to you, but were rebuffed. They seem to act as if there is no problem at all, simply moving on with life without admitting or even trying to deal with the negative feelings. Or perhaps you have taken a similar approach yourself: Have you ever had an important test to study for or an important job interview coming up, and rather than planning and preparing for it, you simply tried put it out of your mind entirely?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p02">Research has found that there are clear difficulties with an approach to negative events and feelings that involves simply trying to ignore them. For one, ignoring our problems does not make them go away. Not being able to get our work done because we are depressed, being too anxious to develop good relationships with others, or experiencing so much stress that we get sick will be detrimental to our life even if we cannot admit that it is occurring.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p03">Suppressing our emotions is also not a very good option, at least in the long run, because it tends to fail (Gross &amp; Levenson, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_072">Gross, J. J., &amp; Levenson, R. W. (1997). Hiding feelings: The acute effects of inhibiting negative and positive emotion. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 106</em>(1), 95–103.</span> If we know that we have a big exam coming up, we have to focus on the exam itself in order to suppress it. We can’t really suppress or deny our thoughts because we actually have to recall and face the event in order to make the attempt to not think about it. Furthermore, we may continually worry that our attempts to suppress will fail. Suppressing our emotions might work out for a short while, but when we run out of energy, the negative emotions may shoot back up into consciousness, causing us to reexperience the negative feelings that we had been trying to avoid.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p04">Daniel Wegner and his colleagues (Wegner, Schneider, Carter, &amp; White, 1987)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_073">Wegner, D. M., Schneider, D. J., Carter, S. R., &amp; White, T. L. (1987). Paradoxical effects of thought suppression. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53</em>(1), 5–13.</span> directly tested whether people would be able to effectively suppress a simple thought. They asked participants in a study to not think about a white bear for 5 minutes but to ring a bell in case they did. (Try it yourself—can you do it?) The participants were unable to suppress the thought as instructed—the white bear kept popping into mind, even when they were instructed to avoid thinking about it. You might have had a similar experience when you were dieting or staying home to study—the chocolate bar in the kitchen cabinet or the fun time you were missing by staying home kept popping into mind, disrupting your work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p05">Another poor approach to attempting to escape from our problems is to engage in behaviors designed to distract us from them. Sometimes this approach will be successful in the short term—we might try distracting ourselves from our troubles by going for a run, watching TV, or reading a book, and perhaps this might be useful. But sometimes people go to extremes to avoid self-awareness when it might be better that they face their troubles directly. If we experience discrepancies between our ideal selves and our important self-concepts, if we feel that we cannot ever live up to our or others’ expectations for us, or if we are just really depressed or anxious, we may attempt to escape ourselves entirely. Roy Baumeister (1991)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_074">Baumeister, R. F. (1991). The self against itself: Escape or defeat? In <em class="emphasis">Relational self: Theoretical convergences in psychoanalysis and social psychology</em> (pp. 238–256). New York, NY: Guilford Press.</span> has speculated that maladaptive behaviors such as drug abuse, sexual masochism, spiritual ecstasy, binge eating, and even suicide are all mechanisms by which people may attempt to escape the self.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p06">Not only does research show that attempting to suppress our negative thoughts does not work, there is even evidence that the opposite is true—that when we are faced with troubles, it is healthy to let the negative thoughts and feelings out by expressing them, either to ourselves or to others. James Pennebaker and his colleagues (Pennebaker, Colder, &amp; Sharp, 1990; Watson &amp; Pennebaker, 1989)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_075">Pennebaker, J. W., Colder, M., &amp; Sharp, L. K. (1990). Accelerating the coping process. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 58</em>(3), 528–537; Watson, D., &amp; Pennebaker, J. W. (1989). Health complaints, stress, and distress: Exploring the central role of negative affectivity. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Review, 96</em>(2), 234–254.</span> have conducted many correlational and experimental studies that demonstrate the advantages to our mental and physical health of opening up versus bottling our feelings. This research team has found that simply talking about or writing about our emotions or our reactions to negative events provides substantial health benefits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p07">Pennebaker and Beall (1986)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_076">Pennebaker, J. W., &amp; Beall, S. K. (1986). Confronting a traumatic event: Toward an understanding of inhibition and disease. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 95</em>(3), 274–281.</span> randomly assigned students to write about either the most traumatic and stressful event of their lives or to write about a trivial topic. Although the students who wrote about the traumas had higher blood pressure and more negative moods immediately after they wrote their essays, they were also less likely to visit the student health center for illnesses during the following 6 months in comparison to those who wrote about more minor issues. Something positive evidently occurred as a result of confronting their negative experiences. Other research studied individuals whose spouses had died in the previous year, finding that the more they talked about the death with others, the less likely they were to become ill during the subsequent year. Daily writing about one’s emotional states has also been found to increase immune system functioning (Petrie, Fontanilla, Thomas, Booth, &amp; Pennebaker, 2004),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_077">Petrie, K.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p08">Opening up probably helps in various ways. For one, expressing our problems allows us to gain information from others and may also bring support from them. And writing or thinking about one’s experiences also seems to help people make sense of the events and may give them a feeling of control over their lives (Pennebaker &amp; Stone, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_079">Pennebaker, J.

        <h2 class="title editable block">A Better Approach: Self-Regulation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p01">As we have seen, emotions are useful in warning us about potential danger and in helping us to make judgments quickly, so it is a good thing that we have them. However, we also need to learn how to control our emotions, to prevent our emotions from letting our behavior get out of control. <em class="emphasis">The process of setting goals and using our cognitive and affective capacities to reach those goals</em> is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">self-regulation</a><span class="glossdef">The process of setting goals and using our cognitive and affective capacities to reach those goals.</span></span>, and a good part of self-regulation involves regulating our emotions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p02">To be the best people that we possibly can, we have to work hard at it. Succeeding at school, at work, and at our relationships with others takes a lot of effort. When we are successful at self-regulation, we are able to move toward or meet the goals that we set for ourselves. When we fail at self-regulation, we are not able to meet those goals. People who are better able to regulate their behaviors and emotions are more successful in their personal and social encounters (Eisenberg &amp; Fabes, 1992),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_080">Eisenberg, N., &amp; Fabes, R. A. (1992). Emotion, regulation, and the development of social competence. In <em class="emphasis">Emotion and social behavior</em> (pp. 119–150). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.</span> and thus self-regulation is a skill we should seek to master.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p03">Being able to exert self-control has some important positive outcomes. Consider, for instance, research by Walter Mischel and his colleagues (Mischel, Shoda, &amp; Rodriguez, 1989).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_081">Mischel, W., Shoda, Y., &amp; Rodriguez, M. L. (1989). Delay of gratification in children. <em class="emphasis">Science</em>, <em class="emphasis">244,</em> 933–938.</span> In their studies, they had 4- and 5-year-old children sit at a table in front of a yummy snack, such as a chocolate chip cookie or a marshmallow. The children were told that they could eat the snack right away if they wanted to. However, they were also told that if they could wait for just a couple of minutes, they’d be able to have two snacks—both the one in front of them and another just like it. However, if they ate the one that was in front of them before the time was up, they would not get a second.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p04">Mischel found that some children were able to self-regulate—they were able to override the impulse to seek immediate gratification in order to obtain a greater reward at a later time. Other children, of course, were not—they just ate the first snack right away. Furthermore, the inability to delay gratification seemed to occur in a spontaneous and emotional manner, without much thought. The children who could not resist simply grabbed the cookie because it looked so yummy, without being able to cognitively stop themselves (Metcalfe &amp; Mischel, 1999; Strack &amp; Deutsch, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_082">Metcalfe, J., &amp; Mischel, W.

The role of impulse in social behavior. In A. W. Kruglanski &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Social psychology: Handbook of basic principles</em> (Vol. 2). New York, NY: Guilford.</span> It turns out that these emotional responses are determined in part by particular brain patterns that are influenced by body chemicals. For instance, preferences for small immediate rewards over large later rewards have been linked to low levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in animals (Bizot, Le Bihan, Peuch, Hamon, &amp; Thiebot, 1999; Wilkinson &amp; Robbins, 2004),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_083">Bizot, J.-C., Le Bihan, C., Peuch, A.

(1976). 5-HIAA in the cerebrospinal fluid: A biochemical suicide predictor? <em class="emphasis">Archives of General Psychiatry, 33</em>(10), 1193–1197.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p05">The ability to self-regulate in childhood has important consequences later in life. When Mischel followed up on the children in his original study, he found that those who had been able to self-regulate as children grew up to have some highly positive characteristics—they got better SAT scores, were rated by their friends as more socially adept, and were found to cope with frustration and stress better than those children who could not resist the tempting first cookie at a young age. Effective self-regulation is therefore an important key to success in life (Ayduk et al., 2000; Eigsti et al., 2006; Mischel, Ayduk, &amp; Mendoza-Denton, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_085">Ayduk, O., Mendoza-Denton, R., Mischel, W., Downey, G., Peake, P.

            <p class="simpara">Emotion Regulation Takes Effort</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p18">Self-regulation is particularly difficult when we are tired, depressed, or anxious, and it is under these conditions that we more easily lose our self-control and fail to live up to our goals (Muraven &amp; Baumeister, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_086">Muraven, M., &amp; Baumeister, R. F. (2000). Self-regulation and depletion of limited resources: Does self-control resemble a muscle? <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 126</em>, 247–259.</span> If you are tired and worried about an upcoming exam, you may find yourself getting angry and taking it out on your roommate, even though she really hasn’t done anything to deserve it and you don’t really want to be angry at her. It is no secret that we are more likely to fail at our diets when we are under a lot of stress or at night when we are tired.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p19">Muraven, Tice, and Baumeister (1998)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_087">Muraven, M., Tice, D. M., &amp; Baumeister, R. F. (1998). Self-control as a limited resource: Regulatory depletion patterns. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74</em>(3), 774–789.</span> conducted a study to demonstrate that emotion regulation—that is, either increasing or decreasing our emotional responses—takes work. They speculated that self-control was like a muscle—it just gets tired when it is used too much. In their experiment, they asked their participants to watch a short movie about environmental disasters involving radioactive waste and their negative effects on wildlife. The scenes included sick and dying animals, which were very upsetting. According to random assignment to conditions, one group (the increase-emotional-response condition) was told to really get into the movie and to express emotions in response to it, a second group was to hold back and decrease emotional responses (the decrease-emotional-response condition), and a third (control) group received no instructions on emotion regulation.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p20">Both before and after the movie, the experimenter asked the participants to engage in a measure of physical strength by squeezing as hard as they could on a hand-grip exerciser, a device used for building up hand muscles. The experimenter put a piece of paper in the grip and timed how long the participants could hold the grip together before the paper fell out. The following table shows the results of this study. It seems that emotion regulation does indeed take effort because the participants who had been asked to control their emotions showed significantly less ability to squeeze the hand grip after the movie than before. Thus the effort to regulate emotional responses seems to have consumed resources, leaving the participants less capacity to make use of in performing the hand-grip task.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Power of Positive Emotions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p01">Although stress is an emotional response that can kill us, other emotions can help us cope with and protect ourselves from stress. The stress of the Monday through Friday grind can be offset by the fun that we can have on the weekend, and the concerns that we have about our upcoming chemistry exam can be offset by a positive attitude toward school, life, and other people. Put simply, the best antidote for stress is a happy one: Think positively, have fun, and enjoy the company of others.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p02">You have probably heard about “the power of positive thinking”—the idea that thinking positively helps people meet their goals and keeps them healthy, happy, and able to effectively cope with the negative events that they experience. It turns out that positive thinking really works. People who think positively about their future, who believe that they can control their outcomes, and who are willing to open up and share with others are healthier people (Seligman &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_092">Seligman, M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p03">The power of positive thinking comes in different forms, but they are all helpful. Some researchers have focused on <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">optimism</a><span class="glossdef">A general tendency to expect positive outcomes.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a general tendency to expect positive outcomes</em>, and have found that optimists are happier and have less stress (Carver &amp; Scheier, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_093">Carver, C.

People with high self-efficacy respond to environmental and other threats in an active, constructive way—by getting information, talking to friends, and attempting to face and reduce the difficulties they are experiencing. These people, too, are better able to ward off their stresses in comparison with people with less self-efficacy (Thompson, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_094">Thompson, S. C.

New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</span> Self-efficacy helps in part because it leads us to perceive that we can control the potential stressors that may affect us. Workers who have control over their work environment (e.g., by being able to move furniture and control distractions) experience less stress, as do patients in nursing homes who are able to choose their everyday activities (Rodin, 1986).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_095">Rodin, J.

Hardiness and health: A prospective study. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 42</em>(1), 168–177.</span> have argued that the tendency to be less affected by life’s stressors can be characterized as an individual-difference measure that has a relationship to both optimism and self-efficacy—a measure known as <em class="emphasis">hardiness</em>. Hardy individuals are those who are more positive overall about potentially stressful life events, who take more direct action to understand the causes of negative events, and who attempt to learn from them what may be of value for the future. Hardy individuals use effective coping strategies, and they take better care of themselves.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p05">Taken together, these various coping skills, including optimism, self-efficacy, perceived control, and hardiness, have been shown to have a wide variety of positive effects on our health.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p06">It is possible to learn to think more positively, and doing so can be beneficial. Antoni et al.

Similar findings were found for older adults.

The <em class="emphasis">direct effects</em> of social support occur, for instance, when one person helps another to better understand and determine how to deal with a stressor or when the other provides direct help or financial assistance.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p23">In some cases, emotional support may be more effective than direct support, in part because the actual seeking of support may itself serve as an additional cause of stress. Asking for help may reduce our own self-esteem and may be seen as unfair to the other (Bolger, Zuckerman, &amp; Kessler 2000; Wethington &amp; Kessler, 1986).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_116">Bolger, N., Zuckerman, A., &amp; Kessler, R.

This difference might lead to the prediction that using others for direct social support would be especially common among Easterners, who focus primarily on other-concern. But asking for social support from others to solve one’s problems may be a particularly Western approach. In Eastern cultures, asking others for help in solving one’s personal problems may be seen as too self-concerned and as making inappropriate demands on the others (Kim, Sherman, &amp; Taylor, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_117">Kim, H.

In individualist cultures, relationships are used in part to promote our individual goals, and it is appropriate to ask for help from those in one’s social networks in order to help one do better. In collectivist cultures, individual goals are more likely to be seen as a means for promoting relationships, and pursuing the goals of self-concern may risk straining relationships if one calls on his or her social support network for aid (Markus, Mullally, &amp; Kitayama, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_119">Markus, H.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p01">One difficulty that people face when trying to improve their well-being is that they may not always know what will make them happy. As one example, many of us think that if we just had more money, we would be happier. While it is true that we do need money to afford food and adequate shelter for ourselves and our families, after this minimum level of wealth is reached, more money does not generally buy more happiness (Easterlin, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_120">Easterlin, R. (2005). Feeding the illusion of growth and happiness: A reply to Hagerty and Veenhoven. <em class="emphasis">Social Indicators Research, 74</em>(3), 429–443. doi:10.1007/ s11205-004-6170-z</span> For instance, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_f01">Figure 3.8 "Income and Happiness"</a>, even though income and material success improved dramatically in many countries in past decades, happiness did not. Despite tremendous economic growth in France, Japan, and the United States between 1946 and 1990, there was no increase in reports of well-being by the citizens of these countries. Americans today have several times the buying power they had in the 1950s, and yet overall happiness has not increased.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p02">The problem seems to be that we never seem to have enough money to make us “really” happy.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p03">These findings might lead us to conclude that we don’t always know what does or might make us happy, and this seems to be at least partially true. For instance, Jean Twenge and her colleagues (Twenge, Campbell, &amp; Foster, 2003)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_122">Twenge, J. M., Campbell, W. K., &amp; Foster, C. A. (2003). Parenthood and marital satisfaction: A meta-analytic review. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Marriage and Family, 65</em>(3), 574–583.</span> reviewed studies relating to the impact of having children on well-being and found that although people with children frequently claim that having children makes them happy, couples who do not have children actually report being happier than those who do.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p04">Psychologists have found that people’s ability to predict their future emotional states is not very accurate (Wilson &amp; Gilbert, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_123">Wilson, T. D., &amp; Gilbert, D. T. (2005). Affective forecasting: Knowing what to want. <em class="emphasis">Current Directions in Psychological Science, 14</em>(3), 131–134.</span> For one, people overestimate their emotional reactions to events. Although people think that positive and negative events that they might experience will make a huge difference in their lives, and although these changes do make at least some difference in well-being, they tend to be less influential than we think they are going to be. Positive events tend to make us feel good, but their effects wear off pretty quickly, and the same is true for negative events. For instance, Brickman, Coates, and Janoff-Bulman (1978)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_124">Brickman, P., Coates, D., &amp; Janoff-Bulman, R. (1978). Lottery winners and accident victims: Is happiness relative? <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 36</em>(8), 917–927.</span> interviewed people who had won more than $50,000 in a lottery and found that they were not happier than they had been in the past and were also not happier than a control group of similar people who had not won the lottery. On the other hand, the researchers found that individuals who were paralyzed as a result of accidents were not as unhappy as might be expected.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p05">How can this possibly be? There are several reasons. For one, people are resilient; they bring their coping skills into play when negative events occur, and this makes them feel better. Second, most people do not continually experience very positive or very negative affect over a long period of time but, rather, adapt to their current circumstances. Just as we enjoy the second chocolate bar we eat less than we enjoy the first, as we experience more and more positive outcomes in our daily lives, we habituate to them and our well-being returns to a more moderate level (Small, Zatorre, Dagher, Evans, &amp; Jones-Gotman, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_125">Small, D. M., Zatorre, R. J., Dagher, A., Evans, A. C., &amp; Jones-Gotman, M. (2001). Changes in brain activity related to eating chocolate. <em class="emphasis">Brain, 124</em>(9), 1720.</span> Another reason we may predict our happiness incorrectly is that our social comparisons change when our own status changes as a result of new events. People who are wealthy compare themselves to other wealthy people, people who are poor tend to compare themselves with other poor people, and people who are ill tend to compare themselves with other ill people. When our comparisons change, our happiness levels are correspondingly influenced. And when people are asked to predict their future emotions, they may focus only on the positive or negative event they are asked about and forget about all the other things that won’t change. Wilson, Wheatley, Meyers, Gilbert, and Axsom (2000)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_126">Wilson, T. D., Wheatley, T., Meyers, J. M., Gilbert, D. T., &amp; Axsom, D. (2000). Focalism: A source of durability bias in affective forecasting. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78</em>(5), 821–836.</span> found that when people were asked to focus on all the more regular things that they will still be doing in the future (working, going to church, socializing with family and friends, etc.), their predictions about how something really good or bad would influence them were less extreme.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p06">If pleasure is fleeting, at least misery shares some of the same quality. We might think we can’t be happy if something terrible, such as the loss of a partner or child, were to happen to us, but after a period of adjustment, most people find that happiness levels return to prior levels (Bonanno et al., 2002).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_127">Bonanno, G.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p07">Our perceptions of our own well-being depend on both situational and person factors. As we have seen, people who report that they have positive social relationships with others—the perception of social support—also report being happier than those who report that they do not have social support (Diener &amp; Suh, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_131">Diener, E., &amp; Suh, E.

Even in an age where the addictive and detrimental health effects of cigarette smoking are well understood, more than 60% of children try smoking before they are 18 years old, and more than half who have smoked have tried and failed to quit (Fryar, Merino, Hirsch, &amp; Porter, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_134">Fryar, C.
