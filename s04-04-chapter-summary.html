<span class="title-prefix">1.4</span> Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s04_p01">The science of social psychology began when scientists first started to systematically and formally measure the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of human beings. Social psychology was energized by a number of researchers who came to the United States from Germany during the Second World War. The 1950s and 1960s saw an expansion of social psychology into the field of attitudes and group processes. In the 1970s and 1980s, the discipline became more cognitive in orientation. Today, the field of social psychology is expanding into still other areas, such as evolutionary psychology, the study of culture, and social neuroscience.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s04_p02">Social psychology is the scientific study of how we think about, feel about, and behave toward the people in our lives and how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by those people. The goal of this book is to help you learn to think like a social psychologist to enable you to use social psychological principles to better understand social relationships.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s04_p03">Social psychology concerns the interplay between the individual person and the social situation. The social situation refers to the other people we interact with every day. The key aspect of the social situation is that the people around us produce social influence, or the processes through which other people change our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and through which we change theirs. Social influence operates largely through social norms.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s04_p04">The most basic tendency of all living organisms is the desire to protect and enhance one’s own life and the lives of important others—self-concern. People also desire to affiliate with others, a motive known as other-concern, and doing so is an important part of human behavior.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s04_p05">An important source of our common human experiences is our culture—a group of people, normally living within a given geographical region, who share a common set of social norms. Norms in Western cultures are primarily oriented toward individualism and self-concern, whereas norms in East Asian cultures are more focused on collectivism and other-concern.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s04_p06">Three fundamental capacities of human beings are affect, behavior, and cognition—the ABCs of social psychology. Affect refers to the feelings we experience as part of our everyday lives. The basic component of affect is mood—the positive or negative feelings that are in the background of our everyday experiences. Emotions are mental states like moods, but they are shorter-lived, stronger, more intense, and more specific forms of affect.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s04_p07">Human beings exchange goods, services, and other benefits with other people in the process of social exchange. The mutual, and generally equitable, exchange of benefits is known as reciprocal altruism.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s04_p08">Social cognition relates to social activities and helps us understand and predict the behavior of ourselves and others. Two types of knowledge particularly important in social psychology are schemas and attitudes.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s04_p09">Although common sense is useful for getting ideas, and although our intuitions are sometimes correct, they are not perfect. Thus social psychologists conduct empirical research to test their ideas. The concepts of interest must be measured using operational definitions. Both self-report and behavioral measures can be used.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s04_p10">One approach to learning about social psychology involves using observational research to make observations of behavior. In some cases, this approach is the only way to learn about and study social events.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s04_p11">Because social psychologists are generally interested in looking at relationships between variables, they begin by stating their predictions in the form of a precise statement known as a research hypothesis.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s04_p12">The goal of correlational research is to search for and test hypotheses about the relationships between two or more variables. In these studies, a statistic known as the Pearson correlation coefficient is used to summarize the association, or correlation, between the variables.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s04_p13">Because scientists are interested in determining the causal relationships among variables, they frequently use experimental research designs. In experiments, the variables of interest are called the independent variable and the dependent variable. The most common method of creating equivalence among the experimental conditions, and thus increasing internal validity, is through random assignment to conditions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s04_p14">External validity refers to the extent to which relationships can be expected to hold up when they are tested again in different ways and for different people. Meta-analyses can be used to assess the observed relationships among variables across many studies.</p>
