    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_p01">To this point in the chapter, we have focused upon the attraction that occurs between people who are initially getting to know one another. But the basic principles of social psychology can also be applied to help us understand relationships that last longer. When good friendships develop, when people get married and plan to spend the rest of their lives together, and when families grow closer over time, the relationships take on new dimensions and must be understood in somewhat different ways. Yet the principles of social psychology can still be applied to help us understand what makes these relationships last. Although humans seem to be the only animals that are able to develop close relationships in which partners stay sexually faithful to each other for a lifetime (Barash &amp; Lipton, 2002),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_072">Barash, D.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_p02">The factors that keep people liking each other in long-term relationships are at least in part the same as the factors that lead to initial attraction. For instance, regardless of how long they have been together, people remain interested in the physical attractiveness of their partners, although it is relatively less important than for initial encounters. And similarity remains essential. Relationships are also more satisfactory and more likely to continue when the individuals develop and maintain similar interests and continue to share their important values and beliefs over time (Davis &amp; Rusbult, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_074">Davis, J. L., &amp; Rusbult, C. E. (2001). Attitude alignment in close relationships. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81</em>(1), 65–84.</span> Proximity also remains important—relationships that undergo the strain of the partners’ being apart from each other for very long are more at risk for breakup.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_p03">But what about passion? Does it still matter over time? Yes and no. People in long-term relationships who are most satisfied with their partners report that they still feel passion for their partners—they still want to be around them as much as possible, and they enjoy making love with them (Simpson, 1987; Sprecher, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_075">Simpson, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_p01">Although it is safe to say that many of the variables that influence initial attraction remain important in longer-term relationships, other variables also come into play over time. One important change is that as a relationship progresses, the partners come to know each other more fully and care about each other to a greater degree. In successful relationships, the partners feel increasingly close to each other over time, whereas in unsuccessful relationships, closeness does not increase and may even decrease. The closeness experienced in these relationships is marked in part by <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">reciprocal self-disclosure</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency to communicate frequently, without fear of reprisal, and in an accepting and empathetic manner.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">the tendency to communicate frequently, without fear of reprisal, and in an accepting and empathetic manner.</em></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_p02">When the partners in a relationship feel that they are close, and when they indicate that the relationship is based on caring, warmth, acceptance, and social support, we can say that the relationship is intimate (Sternberg, 1986).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_078">Sternberg, R. (1986). A triangular theory of love. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Review, 93</em>, 119–135.</span> Partners in intimate relationships are likely to think of the couple as “we” rather than as two separate individuals. People who have a sense of closeness with their partner are better able to maintain positive feelings about the relationship while at the same time being able to express negative feelings and to have accurate (although sometimes less than positive) judgments of the other (Neff &amp; Karney, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_079">Neff, L. A., &amp; Karney, B. R. (2002). Self-evaluation motives in close relationships: A model of global enhancement and specific verification. In P. Noller &amp; J. A. Feeney (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Understanding marriage: Developments in the study of couple interaction</em> (pp. 32–58). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.</span> People may also use their close partner’s positive characteristics to feel better about themselves (Lockwood, Dolderman, Sadler, &amp; Gerchak, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_080">Lockwood, P., Dolderman, D., Sadler, P., &amp; Gerchak, E.

Inclusion of other in the self scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63</em>(4), 596–612.</span> have assessed the role of closeness in relationships directly, using the simple measure shown in <a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_f01">Figure 8.6 "Measuring Relationship Closeness"</a>. You might try completing the measure yourself for some different people that you know—for instance, your family members, your friends, your spouse, or your girlfriend or boyfriend. The measure is simple to use and to interpret. If a person chooses a circle that represents the self and the other as more overlapping, this means that the relationship is close. But if they choose a circle that is less overlapping, then the relationship is less so.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_p04">Although the closeness measure is simple, it has been found to be highly predictive of people’s satisfaction with their close relationships and of the tendency for couples to stay together. In fact, the perceived closeness between romantic partners can be a better predictor of how long a relationship will last than is the number of positive feelings that the partners indicate having for each other. In successful close relationships cognitive representations of the self and the other tend to merge together into one, and it is this tie—based on acceptance, caring, and social support—that is so important (Aron, Aron, Tudor, &amp; Nelson, 1991).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_083">Aron, A., Aron, E.

In a laboratory, they paired college students with another student, one whom they did not know. Some of the students were asked to share some intimate thoughts with each other by asking and answering questions such as “When did you last cry in front of another person?” In comparison with control participants who only engaged in small talk with their partners (answering questions such as “What is your favorite holiday?”), the students who disclosed more intimate experiences reported feeling significantly closer to each other at the end of the conversation.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Communal and Exchange Relationships</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p01">In intimate close relationships, the partners can become highly attuned to each other’s needs, such that the desires and goals of the other become as important as, or more important than, one’s own needs. When people are attentive to the needs of others—for instance, parents’ attentiveness to the needs of their children or the attentiveness of partners in a romantic relationship—and when they help the other person meet his or her needs without explicitly keeping track of what they are giving or expecting to get in return, we say that the partners have a communal relationship. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Communal relationships</a><span class="glossdef">A close relationship in which partners suspend their need for equity and exchange, giving themselves to the partner in order to meet his or her needs, and without consideration of the costs to themselves.</span></span> are <em class="emphasis">close relationships in which partners suspend their need for equity and exchange, giving support to the partner in order to meet his or her needs, and without consideration of the costs to themselves.</em> Communal relationships are contrasted with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exchange relationships</a><span class="glossdef">A relationship in which each of the partners keeps track of his or her contributions to the partnership.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">relationships in which each of the partners keeps track of his or her contributions to the partnership.</em></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p02">Suggesting that communal relationships can be beneficial, research has found that happier couples are less likely to “keep score” of their respective contributions (Buunk, Van Yperen, Taylor, &amp; Collins, 1991).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_085">Buunk, B. P., Van Yperen, N. W., Taylor, S. E., &amp; Collins, R. L. (1991). Social comparison and the drive upward revisited: Affiliation as a response to marital stress. <em class="emphasis">European Journal of Social Psychology, 21</em>(6), 529–546.</span> And when people are reminded of the external benefits that their partners provide them, they may experience decreased feelings of love for them (Seligman, Fazio, &amp; Zanna, 1980).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_086">Seligman, C., Fazio, R. H., &amp; Zanna, M. P. (1980). Effects of salience of extrinsic rewards on liking and loving. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 38</em>(3), 453–460.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p03">Although partners in long-term relationships are frequently willing and ready to help each other meet their needs, and although they will in some cases forgo the need for exchange and reciprocity, this does not mean that they always or continually give to the relationship without expecting anything in return. Partners do keep track of their contributions and received benefits. If one or both of the partners feel that they are unfairly contributing more than their fair share, and if this inequity continues over a period of time, the relationship will suffer. Partners who feel that they are contributing more will naturally become upset because they will feel that they are being taken advantage of. But the partners who feel that they are receiving more than they deserve might feel guilty about their lack of contribution to the partnership.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p04">Members of long-term relationships focus to a large extent on maintaining equity, and marriages are happiest when both members perceive that they contribute relatively equally (Van Yperen &amp; Buunk, 1990).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_087">Van Yperen, N. W., &amp; Buunk, B. P. (1990). A longitudinal study of equity and satisfaction in intimate relationships. <em class="emphasis">European Journal of Social Psychology, 20</em>(4), 287–309.</span> People stay in relationships longer when they feel that they are being rewarded by them (Margolin &amp; Wampold, 1981).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_088">Margolin, G., &amp; Wampold, B. E. (1981). Sequential analysis of conflict and accord in distressed and nondistressed marital partners. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 49</em>(4), 554–567.</span> In short, in relationships that last, the partners are aware of the needs of the other person and attempt to meet them equitably. But partners in the best relationships are also able to look beyond the rewards themselves and to think of the relationship in a communal way.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Interdependence and Commitment</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_p01">Another factor that makes long-term relationships different from short-term ones is that they are more complex. When a couple begins to take care of a household together, has children, and perhaps has to care for elderly parents, the requirements of the relationship become correspondingly bigger. As a result of this complexity, the partners in close relationships increasingly turn to each other not only for social support but also for help in coordinating activities, remembering dates and appointments, and accomplishing tasks (Wegner, Erber, &amp; Raymond, 1991).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_089">Wegner, D. M., Erber, R., &amp; Raymond, P. (1991). Transactive memory in close relationships. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 61</em>(6), 923–929.</span> The members of a close relationship are highly <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interdependent</a><span class="glossdef">In a close relationship, relying to a great degree on each other to meet goals.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">relying to a great degree on each other to meet their goals.</em></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_p02">It takes a long time for partners in a relationship to develop the ability to understand the other person’s needs and to form positive patterns of interdependence in which each person’s needs are adequately met. The social representation of a significant other is a rich, complex, and detailed one because we know and care so much about him or her and because we have spent so much time in his or her company (Andersen &amp; Cole, 1990).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_090">Andersen, S. M., &amp; Cole, S. W. (1990). “Do I know you?” The role of significant others in general social perception. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 59</em>(3), 384–399.</span> Because a lot of energy has been invested in creating the relationship, particularly when the relationship includes children, breaking off the partnership becomes more and more costly with time. After spending a long time with one person, it may also become more and more difficult to imagine ourselves with anyone else.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_p03">In relationships in which a positive rapport between the partners is developed and maintained over a period of time, the partners are naturally happy with the relationship and they become committed to it. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Commitment</a><span class="glossdef">The feelings and actions that keep partners working together to maintain the relationship.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">the feelings and actions that keep partners working together to maintain the relationship</em>. In comparison to those who are less committed, partners who are more committed to the relationship see their mates as more attractive than others, are less able to imagine themselves with another partner, express less interest in other potential mates, are less aggressive toward each other, and are less likely to break up (Simpson, 1987; Slotter et al., 2011).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_091">Slotter, B., Finkel, E. J., DeWall, C. N., Pond, R. S., Jr., Lambert, N. M., Bodenhausen, G. V., &amp; Fincham, F. D. (2011, August 8).

A. (1987). The dissolution of romantic relationships: Factors involved in relationship stability and emotional distress. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53</em>(4), 683–692.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_p04">Commitment may in some cases lead individuals to stay in relationships that they could leave, even though the costs of remaining in the relationship are very high. On the surface, this seems puzzling because people are expected to attempt to maximize their rewards in relationships and would be expected to leave them if they are not rewarding. But in addition to evaluating the outcomes that one gains from a given relationship, the individual also evaluates the potential costs of moving to another relationship or not having any relationship at all. We might stay in a romantic relationship, even if the benefits of that relationship are not high, because the costs of being in no relationship at all are perceived as even higher. In short, when considering whether to stay or leave, we must consider both the costs and benefits of the current relationship and the costs and benefits of the alternatives to it (Rusbult, Olsen, Davis, &amp; Hannon, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_092">Rusbult, C. E., Olsen, N., Davis, J. L., &amp; Hannon, P. A. (2001). Commitment and relationship maintenance mechanisms. In J. Harvey &amp; A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_p05">Although the good news about interdependence and commitment is clear—they help relationships last longer—they also have a potential downside. Breaking up, should it happen, is more difficult in relationships that are interdependent and committed. The closer and more committed a relationship has been, the more devastating a breakup will be.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s04_p01">Although we have talked about it indirectly, we have not yet tried to define love itself—and yet it is obviously the case that close relationships are all about love. Social psychologists have studied the function and characteristics of romantic love, finding that it has cognitive, affective, and behavioral components and that it occurs cross-culturally. Romantic love is found in all cultures, although how it is experienced may vary.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s04_p03">Evolutionary psychologists have proposed that we experience romantic love to help increase our evolutionary fitness (Taylor &amp; Gonzaga, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_095">Taylor, S.

Madison, CT: Psychosocial Press.</span> According to this idea, love helps couples work together to improve the relationship by coordinating and planning activities and by increasing commitment to the partnership. If love acts as a “commitment device,” it may do so in part by helping people avoid being attracted to other people who may pose a threat to the stability of the relationship (Gonzaga, Haselton, Smurda, Davies, &amp; Poore, 2008; Sabini &amp; Silver, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_096">Gonzaga, G.

They predicted that the romantic love manipulation would decrease attention to faces of attractive opposite-sex people.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s04_p05">One half of the participants (the <em class="emphasis">romantic love condition</em>) were assigned to write a brief essay about a time in which they experienced strong feelings of love for their current partner. Participants assigned to the <em class="emphasis">control condition</em> wrote a brief essay about a time in which they felt extremely happy. After completing the essay, participants completed a procedure in which they were shown a series of attractive and unattractive male and female faces. The procedure assessed how quickly the participants could shift their attention away from the photo they were looking at to a different photo. The dependent variable was the reaction time (in milliseconds) with which participants could shift their attention.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s04_p06">As you can see in the preceding figure, the participants who had been asked to think about their thoughts and feelings of love for their partner were faster at moving their attention from the attractive opposite-sex photos than were participants in any of the other conditions. When experiencing feelings of romantic love, participants’ attention seemed repelled, rather than captured, by highly attractive members of the opposite sex. These findings suggest that romantic love may inhibit the perceptual processing of physical attractiveness cues—the very same cues that often pose a high degree of threat to the relationship.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s05_p01">One of the important determinants of the quality of close relationships is the way that the partners relate to each other.

These children perceive their parents as safe, available, and responsive caregivers and are able to relate easily to them. For these children, the parents successfully create appropriate feelings of affiliation and provide a secure base from which the child feels free to explore and then to return to. However, for children with unhealthy attachment styles, the family does not provide these needs. Some children develop an <em class="emphasis">anxious/ambivalent attachment style</em>, becoming overly dependent upon the parents and continually seeking more affection from them than they can give. These children are anxious about whether the parents will reciprocate closeness. Still other children become unable to relate to the parents at all, becoming distant, fearful, and cold (the <em class="emphasis">avoidant attachment style</em>).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s05_p06">One way to think about attachment styles, shown in <a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s05_t01">Table 8.1 "Attachment as Self-Concern and Other-Concern"</a>, is in terms of the extent to which the individual is able to successfully meet the important goals of self-concern and other-concern in his or her close relationships. People with a secure attachment style have positive feelings about themselves and also about others. People with anxious/ambivalent attachment styles feel good about themselves (the goal of self-concern is being met), but they do not have particularly good relations with others. People with avoidant attachment styles are primarily other-concerned. They want desperately to be liked, but they do not have a very positive opinion of themselves; this lack of self-esteem hurts their ability to form good relationships. The fourth cell in the table, lower right, represents people who are not meeting goals of either self-concern or other-concern. We can call this attachment style <em class="emphasis">fearful-avoidant</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s05_p07">This way of thinking about attachment shows, again, the importance of both self-concern and other-concern in successful social interaction. People who cannot connect with others do not make good partners. But people who do not feel good about themselves also are not good partners—self-concern goals must be met before we can successfully meet the goals of other-concern.</p>

The quality of the relationships that people have with their parents and close friends will predict the quality of their romantic relationships. But although they are very important, attachment styles do not predict everything. People have many experiences as adults, and these interactions can influence, both positively and negatively, their ability to develop close relationships (Baldwin &amp; Fehr, 1995; Scharfe &amp; Bartholomew, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_111">Baldwin, M.

In their research, a previously unacquainted male and female college student met each other for the first time either in what they thought was an Internet chat room or face-to-face. Those who met first on the Internet reported liking each other more than those who met first face-to-face—even when it was the same partner that they had met both times. People also report being better able to express their own emotions and experiences to their partners online than in face-to-face meetings (Bargh, McKenna, &amp; Fitzsimons, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_118">Bargh, J.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s05_p13">There are probably a number of reasons why Internet relationships can be so successful. For one, relationships grow to the extent that the partners self-disclose by sharing personal information with each other, and the relative anonymity of Internet interactions may allow people to self-disclose more readily. Another characteristic of Internet relationships is the relative lack of physical cues to a person’s attractiveness. When physical attractiveness is taken out of the picture, people may be more likely to form relationships on the basis of other more important characteristics, such as similarity in values and beliefs. Another advantage of the Internet is that it allows people to stay in touch with friends and family who are not nearby and to maintain better long-distance relationships (Wellman, Quan Haase, Witte, &amp; Hampton, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_119">Wellman, B., Quan Haase, A., Witte, J., &amp; Hampton, K.

Finally, the major purpose of many Internet activities is to make new friends. In contrast, most face-to-face interactions are less conducive to starting new conversations and friendships.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s05_p14">Overall, then, the evidence suggests that rather than being an isolating activity, interacting with others over the Internet helps us maintain close ties with our family and friends and in many cases helps us form intimate and rewarding relationships.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s06_p01">Because liking and loving are so central to human experience, they are determined in large part by fundamental human biological mechanisms.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s06_p02">The hormones that are released during the female menstrual cycle influence women’s attraction to men. Women become more attracted to men, especially to those with symmetrical and particularly masculine characteristics, during the times in their menstrual cycles when they are most likely to become pregnant (Gangestad, Thornhill, &amp; Garver-Apgar, 2005; Pillsworth &amp; Haselton, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_124">Gangestad, S.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s06_p03">The male sex hormone testosterone also relates to liking, but particularly for passionate love. Testosterone is related to an increased sex drive in both men and women. However, over the long term, testosterone does not help people stay together. In comparison with men who are in short-term sexual relationships, those in long-term relationships have relatively lower levels of testosterone, and people who are married have lower levels of testosterone in comparison with people who are single (Dabbs &amp; Dabbs, 2000; Gray et al., 2004).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_126">Dabbs, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s07_p01">Now that you have a better idea of the variables that lead to interpersonal attraction and that are important in close relationships, you should be getting a pretty good idea of the things that partners need to do to help them stay together. It is true that many marriages end in divorce, and this number is higher in individualistic cultures, where the focus is on the individual, than it is in collectivistic cultures, where the focus is on maintaining group togetherness. But even in the West, the number of divorces is falling, at least for the most educated segments of U.S. society (Marriage Project, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_127">University of Virginia. The National Marriage Project. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.virginia.edu/marriageproject">http://www.virginia.edu/marriageproject</a></span> Successful relationships take work, but the work is worth it. People who are happily married are also happier overall and have better psychological and physical health. And at least for men, marriage leads to a longer life (Kiecolt-Glaser &amp; Newton, 2002).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s07_p02">In part, the ideas of Britain’s long-married couple Frank and Anita Milford about what made their relationship so successful are probably correct. Let’s look at some of the things that they seem to have done and compare them with what we might expect on the basis of social psychological research.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s07_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be prepared for squabbles.</strong> Every relationship has conflict. This is not unexpected or always bad. Working through minor conflicts can help you and your partner improve your social skills and make the relationship stronger (Pickett &amp; Gardner, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_128">Pickett, C.

</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Don’t be negative.</strong> Negative cognitions and emotions have an extremely harmful influence on relationships (Gottman, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_129">Gottman, J. M. (1994). <em class="emphasis">What predicts divorce?</em> Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.</span> Don’t let a spiral of negative thinking and negative behaviors get started. Do whatever you can to think positively.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be fair in how you evaluate behaviors.</strong> People in close relationships, as do most people in their everyday lives, tend to inflate their own self-worth. They rate their own positive behaviors as better than their partner’s, and rate their partner’s negative behaviors as worse than their own. Try to give your partner the benefit of the doubt—remember that you are not perfect either.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Don’t do something dumb.</strong> Relationships break up when one or both of the partners betray the relationship. Of course sexual infidelities create a major strain, but women are also concerned about emotional infidelity in their partners. (Men: Stop flirting; it will make your partner jealous!) Marriages are happier when the partners focus on each other and not on other potential mates (Maner et al., 2009).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_130">Maner, J. K., Miller, S.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Do things that please your partner.</strong> The principles of social exchange make it clear that being nice to others leads them to be nice in return.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Have fun.</strong> Relationships in which the partners have positive moods and in which the partners are not bored tend to last longer (Tsapelas, Aron, &amp; Orbuch, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_131">Tsapelas, I., Aron, A., &amp; Orbuch, T.

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s07_p03">Partners who are able to remain similar in their values and other beliefs are going to be more successful. This seems to have been the case for Frank and Anita—they continued to share activities and interests. Partners must also display positive affect toward each other. Happy couples are in positive moods when they are around each other—they laugh together, and they express approval rather than criticism of each other’s behaviors. Partners are happier when they view the other person in a positive or even “idealized” sense rather than in a more realistic and perhaps more negative one (Murray, Holmes, &amp; Griffin, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_133">Murray, S. L., Holmes, J. G., &amp; Griffin, D. W. (1996). The benefits of positive illusions: Idealization and the construction of satisfaction in close relationships. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70</em>(1), 79–98.</span> Anita and Frank talked in their interview about how their time together was characterized by positive feelings and romance, and perhaps that helped them stay together.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s07_p04">Next, the partners must share, in the sense that they are willing to express their thoughts about each other. Successful relationships involve self-disclosure of one’s own needs and desires, which allows the partner to become aware of the needs of the other and attempt to meet them if possible. If the partners are not able to express their concerns, then the relationship cannot become more intimate. Successful relationships have successful communication patterns.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s07_p05">Finally, but not least important, are social behaviors. Many people think (based in part on what they see on TV and read about) that extramarital affairs are a common part of close relationships. But research suggests that this is not the case. A survey by the Chicago Social Health and Life Survey (Chicago Health and Social Life Survey, 2011)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_134">University of Chicago. Chicago health and social life survey. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://popcenter.uchicago.edu/data/chsls.shtml">http://popcenter.uchicago.edu/data/chsls.shtml</a></span> found not only that 87% of married partners believe that extramarital sex is wrong but that the partners also seemed to act in accordance with these values. In answering the survey, 75% of the men and 90% of the women claimed to have been completely faithful to their partner over their entire marriage. And extramarital affairs, when they do occur, are likely to be one-time events.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s07_p06">These data confirm that partners must refrain from engaging in behaviors that are harmful to the relationship, such as cheating on a partner, because these are naturally disruptive to a happy relationship. Partners do not expect or tolerate cheating. “Open marriages” do not work; infidelity in relationships is strongly associated with divorce (Wiederman, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_135">Wiederman, M. W. (1997). Extramarital sex: Prevalence and correlates in a national survey. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Sex Research, 34</em>(2), 167–174.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s07_p07">Even if a person does not actually cheat by having sex with someone else, his or her partner may still be jealous, and jealously can harm relationships. Jealousy is a powerful emotion that has been evolutionarily selected to help maintain close relationships. Both men and women experience jealousy, although they experience it to different extents and in different ways. Men are more jealous than women overall. And men are more concerned than women about sexual infidelities of their partners, whereas women are relatively more concerned about emotional infidelities of their partners (Buss, Larsen, Westen, &amp; Semmelroth, 1992).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_136">Buss, D. M., Larsen, R. J., Westen, D., &amp; Semmelroth, J. (1992). Sex differences in jealousy: Evolution, physiology, and psychology. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science, 3</em>(4), 251–255.</span> Men’s concern with sexual cheating is probably due in large part to evolutionary factors related to kin selection: Men need to be particularly sure that their partners are sexually faithful to them to ensure that the time they spend raising children is spent on raising their own children, not those of others. And women’s concern with emotional fidelity fits with a focus on maintaining the relationship intact. Flirting suggests that the man is not really committed to the relationship and may leave it.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s08_p01">Inevitably, some relationships do break up, and these separations may cause substantial pain. When the partners have been together for a long time, particularly in a relationship characterized by interdependence and commitment, the pain is even greater (Simpson, 1987).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_137">Simpson, J. A. (1987). The dissolution of romantic relationships: Factors involved in relationship stability and emotional distress. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53</em>(4), 683–692.</span> The pain of a breakup is in part due to the loneliness that results from it. People who lose someone they care about also lose a substantial amount of social support, and it takes time to recover and develop new social connections. Lonely people sleep more poorly, take longer to recover from stress, and show poorer health overall (Cacioppo et al., 2002).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_138">Cacioppo, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch08_s02_s08_p02">The pain of a loss may be magnified when people feel that they have been rejected by the other. The experience of rejection makes people sad, angry, more likely to break social norms, and more focused on self-concern. The ability to effectively self-regulate is lowered, and people are more likely to act on their impulses (Baumeister, DeWall, Ciarocco, &amp; Twenge, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_139">Baumeister, R.

Social exclusion impairs self-regulation. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 88</em>(4), 589–604.</span> But people who have been rejected are also more motivated by other-concern; they are particularly likely to try to make new friends to help make up for the rejection (Gardner, Pickett, &amp; Brewer, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn08_140">Gardner, W.
