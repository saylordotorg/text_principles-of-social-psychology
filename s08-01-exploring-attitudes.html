The attitude object might be a person, a product, or a social group (Albarracín, Johnson, &amp; Zanna, 2005; Wood, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn05_003">Albarracín, D., Johnson, B.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Attitudes Are Evaluations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p01">When we say that attitudes are evaluations, we mean that they involve a preference for or against the attitude object, as commonly expressed in such terms as <em class="emphasis">prefer</em>, <em class="emphasis">like</em>, <em class="emphasis">dislike</em>, <em class="emphasis">hate</em>, and <em class="emphasis">love</em>. When we express our attitudes—for instance, when we say, “I love Cheerios,” “I hate snakes,” “I'm crazy about Bill,” or “I like Italians”—we are expressing the relationship (either positive or negative) between the self and an attitude object. Statements such as these make it clear that attitudes are an important part of the self-concept—attitudes tie the self-concept to the attitude object, and so our attitudes are an essential part of “us.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p02">Every human being holds thousands of attitudes, including those about family and friends, political parties and political figures, abortion rights and terrorism, preferences for music, and much more. Each of our attitudes has its own unique characteristics, and no two attitudes come to us or influence us in quite the same way. Research has found that some of our attitudes are inherited, at least in part, via genetic transmission from our parents (Olson, Vernon, Harris, &amp; Jang, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn05_004">Olson, J. M., Vernon, P. A., Harris, J. A., &amp; Jang, K. L. (2001). The heritability of attitudes: A study of twins. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 80</em>(6), 845–860.</span> Other attitudes are learned mostly through direct and indirect experiences with the attitude objects (De Houwer, Thomas, &amp; Baeyens, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn05_005">De Houwer, J., Thomas, S., &amp; Baeyens, F.

Still other attitudes are learned via the media (Hargreaves &amp; Tiggemann, 2003; Levina, Waldo, &amp; Fitzgerald, 2000)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn05_006">Levina, M., Waldo, C.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p09">Although most attitudes are determined by cognition, affect, and behavior, there is nevertheless variability in this regard across people and across attitudes. Some attitudes are more likely to be based on beliefs, some more likely to be based on feelings, and some more likely to be based on behaviors. I would say that my attitude toward chocolate ice cream is in large part determined by affect—although I can describe its taste, mostly I just like it. My attitudes toward my Toyota Corolla and my home air conditioner, on the other hand, are more cognitive. I don't really like them so much as I admire their positive features (the Toyota gets good gas mileage and the air conditioner keeps me cool on hot summer days). Still other of my attitudes are based more on behavior—I feel like I’ve learned to like my neighbors because I’ve done favors for them over the years (which they have returned) and these helpful behaviors on my part have, at least in part, led me to develop a positive attitude toward them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p10">Different people may hold attitudes toward the same attitude object for different reasons. Some people voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 elections because they like his policies (“he's working for the middle class”; “he wants to increase automobile fuel efficiency”), whereas others voted for (or against) him because they just liked (or disliked) him. Although you might think that cognition would be more important in this regard, political scientists have shown that many voting decisions are made primarily on the basis of affect. Indeed, it is fair to say that the affective component of attitudes is generally the strongest and most important (Abelson, Kinder, Peters, &amp; Fiske, 1981; Stangor, Sullivan, &amp; Ford, 1991).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn05_010">Abelson, R.

Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.</span> Some of our attitudes are strong attitudes, in the sense that we find them important, hold them with confidence, do not change them very much, and use them frequently to guide our actions. These strong attitudes may guide our actions completely out of our awareness (Ferguson, Bargh, &amp; Nayak, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn05_017">Ferguson, M. J., Bargh, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p02">Other attitudes are weaker and have little influence on our actions. For instance, John Bargh and his colleagues (Bargh, Chaiken, Raymond, &amp; Hymes, 1996)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn05_018">Bargh, J. A., Chaiken, S., Raymond, P., &amp; Hymes, C.

The researchers also found that these attitudes were very weak. On the other hand, the heavy voter turnout for Barack Obama in the 2008 elections was probably because many of his supporters had strong positive attitudes about him.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p03">Strong attitudes are attitudes that are more cognitively accessible—they come to mind quickly, regularly, and easily. We can easily measure attitude strength by assessing how quickly our attitudes are activated when we are exposed to the attitude object. If we can state our attitude quickly, without much thought, then it is a strong one. If we are unsure about our attitude and need to think about it for a while before stating our opinion, the attitude is weak.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p04">Attitudes become stronger when we have direct positive or negative experiences with the attitude object, and particularly if those experiences have been in strong positive or negative contexts.

Although the people who watched ended up either liking or disliking the puzzles as much as the people who actually worked on them, Fazio found that attitudes, as assessed by reaction time measures, were stronger (in the sense of being expressed quickly) for the people who had directly experienced the puzzles.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p05">Because attitude strength is determined by cognitive accessibility, it is possible to make attitudes stronger by increasing the accessibility of the attitude. This can be done directly by having people think about, express, or discuss their attitudes with others. After people think about their attitudes, talk about them, or just say them out loud, the attitudes they have expressed become stronger (Downing, Judd, &amp; Brauer, 1992; Tesser, Martin, &amp; Mendolia, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn05_020">Downing, J.

(1995). <em class="emphasis">The impact of thought on attitude extremity and attitude-behavior consistency</em>. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.</span> Because attitudes are linked to the self-concept, they also become stronger when they are activated along with the self-concept. When we are looking into a mirror or sitting in front of a TV camera, our attitudes are activated and we are then more likely to act on them (Beaman, Klentz, Diener, &amp; Svanum, 1979).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn05_021">Beaman, A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p06">Attitudes are also stronger when the ABCs of affect, behavior, and cognition all line up. As an example, many people’s attitude toward their own nation is universally positive. They have strong positive feelings about their country, many positive thoughts about it, and tend to engage in behaviors that support it. Other attitudes are less strong because the affective, cognitive, and behavioral components are each somewhat different (Thompson, Zanna, &amp; Griffin, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn05_022">Thompson, M. M., Zanna, M. P., &amp; Griffin, D. W. (1995). Let’s not be indifferent about (attitudinal) ambivalence. In <em class="emphasis">Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences</em> (pp. 361–386). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.</span> My affect toward chocolate ice cream is positive—I like it a lot. On the other hand, my cognitions are more negative—I know that eating too much ice cream can make me fat and that it is bad for my coronary arteries. And even though I love chocolate ice cream, I don’t eat some every time I get a chance. These inconsistencies among the components of my attitude make it less strong than it would be if all the components lined up together.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p01">Social psychologists (as well as advertisers, marketers, and politicians) are particularly interested in the behavioral aspect of attitudes. Because it is normal that the ABCs of our attitudes are at least somewhat consistent, our behavior tends to follow from our affect and cognition. If I determine that you have more positive cognitions about and more positive affect toward Cheerios than Frosted Flakes, then I will naturally predict (and probably be correct when I do so) that you’ll be more likely to buy Cheerios than Frosted Flakes when you go to the market. Furthermore, if I can do something to make your thoughts or feelings toward Frosted Flakes more positive, then your likelihood of buying that cereal instead of the other will also increase.</p>

Supporting this idea, meta-analyses have found that there is a significant and substantial positive correlation among the different components of attitudes, and that attitudes expressed on self-report measures do predict behavior (Glasman &amp; Albarracín, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn05_023">Glasman, L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p04">Attitudes only predict behaviors well under certain conditions and for some people. The preceding list summarizes the factors that create a strong attitude-behavior relationship.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p05">People who have strong attitudes toward an attitude object are also likely to have strong <em class="emphasis">intentions</em> to act on their attitudes, and the intention to engage in an activity is a strong predictor of behavior (Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn05_028">Fishbein, M., &amp; Ajzen, I. (1975). <em class="emphasis">Belief, attitude, intention and behavior: An introduction to theory and research</em>. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.</span> Imagine for a moment that your friend Sharina is trying to decide whether to recycle her used laptop batteries or just throw them away. We know that her attitude toward recycling is positive—she thinks she should do it—but we also know that recycling takes work. It’s much easier to just throw the batteries away. Only if Sharina has a strong attitude toward recycling will she then have the necessary strong intentions to engage in the behavior that will make her recycle her batteries even when it is difficult to do.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p06">The match between the social situations in which the attitudes are expressed and the behaviors are engaged in also matters, such that there is a greater attitude-behavior correlation when the social situations match. Imagine for a minute the case of Magritte, a 16-year-old high school student. Magritte tells her parents that she hates the idea of smoking cigarettes. Magritte’s negative attitude toward smoking seems to be a strong one because she’s thought a lot about it—she believes that cigarettes are dirty, expensive, and unhealthy. But how sure are you that Magritte’s attitude will predict her behavior? Would you be willing to bet that she’d never try smoking when she’s out with her friends?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p07">You can see that the problem here is that Magritte’s attitude is being expressed in one social situation (when she is with her parents) whereas the behavior (trying a cigarette) is going to occur in a very different social situation (when she is out with her friends). The relevant social norms are of course much different in the two situations. Magritte’s friends might be able to convince her to try smoking, despite her initial negative attitude, when they entice her with peer pressure. Behaviors are more likely to be consistent with attitudes when the social situation in which the behavior occurs is similar to the situation in which the attitude is expressed (Ajzen, 1991; LaPiere, 1936).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn05_029">Ajzen, I.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p08">Another variable that has an important influence on attitude-behavior consistency is the current cognitive accessibility of the underlying affective and cognitive components of the attitude. For example, if we assess the attitude in a situation in which people are thinking primarily about the attitude object in cognitive terms, and yet the behavior is performed in a situation in which the affective components of the attitude are more accessible, then the attitude-behavior relationship will be weak. Wilson and Schooler (1991)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn05_030">Wilson, T. D., &amp; Schooler, J. W. (1991). Thinking too much: Introspection can reduce the quality of preferences and decisions. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60</em>(2), 181–192.</span> showed a similar type of effect by first choosing attitudes that they expected would be primarily determined by affect—attitudes toward five different types of strawberry jam. Then they asked a sample of college students to taste each of the jams. While they were tasting, one-half of the participants were instructed to think about the cognitive aspects of their attitudes to these jams—that is, to focus on the reasons they held their attitudes, whereas the other half of the participants were not given these instructions. Then all the students completed measures of their attitudes toward each of the jams.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p09">Wilson and his colleagues then assessed the extent to which the attitudes expressed by the students correlated with taste ratings of the five jams as indicated by experts at <em class="emphasis">Consumer Reports</em>. They found that the attitudes expressed by the students correlated significantly higher with the expert ratings for the participants who had <em class="emphasis">not</em> listed their cognitions first. Wilson and his colleagues argued that this occurred because our liking of jams is primarily affectively determined—we either like them or we don’t. And the students who simply rated the jams used their feelings to make their judgments. On the other hand, the students who were asked to list their thoughts about the jams had some extra information to use in making their judgments, but it was information that was not actually useful. Therefore, when these students used their thoughts about the jam to make the judgments, their judgments were less valid.</p>

However, according to random assignment to conditions, half of the men were shown the video while sober and the other half viewed the video after they had had several alcoholic drinks. In the video, Mike and Rebecca go to the campus bar and drink and dance. They then go to Rebecca’s room, where they end up kissing passionately. Mike says that he doesn’t have any condoms, but Rebecca says that she is on the pill.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p11">At this point the film clip ends, and the male participants are asked about their likely behaviors if they had been Mike. Although all men indicated that having unprotected sex in this situation was foolish and irresponsible, the men who had been drinking alcohol were more likely to indicate that they would engage in sexual intercourse with Rebecca even without a condom. One interpretation of this study is that sexual behavior is determined by both cognitive factors (“I know that it is important to practice safe sex and so I should use a condom”) and affective factors (“sex is enjoyable, I don’t want to wait”). When the students were intoxicated at the time the behavior was to be performed, it seems likely the affective component of the attitude was a more important determinant of behavior than was the cognitive component.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p12">One other type of “match” that has an important influence on the attitude-behavior relationship concerns how we measure the attitude and behavior. Attitudes predict behavior better when the attitude is measured at a level that is similar to the behavior to be predicted. Normally, the behavior is specific, so it is better to measure the attitude at a specific level too. For instance, if we measure cognitions at a very general level (“do you think it is important to use condoms?”; “are you a religious person?”) we will not be as successful at predicting actual behaviors as we will be if we ask the question more specifically, at the level of behavior we are interested in predicting (“do you think you will use a condom the next time you have sex?”; “how frequently do you expect to attend church in the next month?”). In general, more specific questions are better predictors of specific behaviors, and thus if we wish to accurately predict behaviors, we should remember to attempt to measure <em class="emphasis">specific</em> attitudes. One example of this principle is shown in <a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_f01">Figure 5.1 "Predicting Behavior From Specific and Nonspecific Attitude Measures"</a>.

To return to our example of Magritte, you might wonder whether she is the type of person who is likely to be persuaded by peer pressure because she is particularly concerned with being liked by others. If she is, then she’s probably more likely to want to fit in with whatever her friends are doing, and she might try a cigarette if her friends offer her one. On the other hand, if Magritte is not particularly concerned about following the social norms of her friends, then she’ll more likely be able to resist the persuasion. <em class="emphasis">High self-monitors</em> are those who tend to attempt to blend into the social situation in order to be liked; <em class="emphasis">low self-monitors</em> are those who are less likely to do so.

                <li>The term <em class="emphasis">attitude</em> refers to our relatively enduring evaluation of an attitude object.</li>
                <li>Our attitudes are inherited and also learned through direct and indirect experiences with the attitude objects.</li>
                <li>Some attitudes are more likely to be based on beliefs, some more likely to be based on feelings, and some more likely to be based on behaviors.</li>
                <li>Strong attitudes are important in the sense that we hold them with confidence, we do not change them very much, and we use them frequently to guide our actions.</li>
                <li>Although there is a general consistency between attitudes and behavior, the relationship is stronger in some situations than in others, for some measurements than for others, and for some people than for others.</li>

                <li>Consider some of your attitudes toward people, products, or other attitude objects. Are your attitudes strong or weak? Are they determined more by affect or by cognition? How do the attitudes influence your behavior?</li>
                <li>Consider a time when you acted on your own attitudes and a time when you did not act on your own attitudes. What factors do you think determined the difference?</li>
