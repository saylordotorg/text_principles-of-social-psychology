In fact, people in almost all nations, both men and women, and people of all ages report that they are satisfied—at least above the neutral point—on ratings of well-being (Diener, Suh, Lucas, &amp; Smith, 1999; Kahneman, Diener, &amp; Schwarz, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_040">Diener, E., Suh, E.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p01">Emotions matter because they influence our behavior. And there is no emotional experience that has a more powerful influence on us than stress.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p02">People who have recently experienced negative situations—for example, being the victim of a terrorist attack or a natural disaster, going through a divorce, or experiencing the death of a close loved one—report experiencing stress. Survivors of Hurricane Katrina had a rate of heart attacks that was three times higher than the national average in the years following the disaster, and this was probably due to the stress that the hurricane created (American Medical Association, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_042">American Medical Association.

The syndrome is frequently experienced by soldiers who return home from wars; those who experience more extreme events during a war also experience more severe PTSD.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p04">Stress is accompanied by increases in arousal. When we experience stress, our heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure increase, and our body begins to secrete adrenaline and other hormones. Perspiration increases to cool down the body. In addition, sugar is released to provide energy, and the pupils dilate to improve our vision. At the same time, the less immediately essential body activities controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), including digestion, are reduced in order to divert more energy to allow the body to react to the threat.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p05">The experience of stress likely had positive aspects for human beings in an evolutionary sense. When we are attacked, afraid, or concerned about our welfare, the body signals us that we need to react, and the stress response is one of those signals. But problems begin when a threat continues over time. When it is extreme or prolonged, stress can create substantial negative mental and physical effects. In fact, when stress occurs for too long, it can lead to exhaustion and even death.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s01_p03">Cortisol is frequently referred to as the “stress hormone,” and it is commonly measured by researchers in order to assess the activation of the HPA axis in response to stress. Cortisol is measured by taking a sample of saliva, which is then analyzed to determine cortisol levels. Cortisol increases when people are stressed, for instance, when they are in dancing competitions (Edelstein, Yim, &amp; Quas, 2010),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_045">Edelstein, R.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s01_p04">The experience of prolonged stress has a direct negative influence on our physical health because at the same time that stress increases activity in the SNS, it also suppresses important activity in the PNS. When stress is long-term, the HPA axis remains active and the adrenals continue to produce cortisol. This increased cortisol production exhausts the stress mechanism, leading to fatigue and depression.</p>

Types of stressors that increase susceptibility to the common cold in adults. <em class="emphasis">Health Psychology, 17,</em> 214–23.</span> demonstrated experimentally that repeated exposure to threats and stress can increase susceptibility to the common cold virus, revealing the causal link between psychological stress and actual susceptibility to disease. To begin, the researchers had adult volunteers fill out several questionnaires about the stressful experiences in their lives. Then the researchers administered nose drops into each participant’s nose. The control group (the lucky ones!) received a placebo saline solution; the experimental group received a solution containing a cold virus. Over the next week, the participants were examined daily by a nurse. None of the control group participants got a cold. But of those exposed to the cold virus, 82% did get a cold. Furthermore, within this condition, those participants who reported enduring long-term stressors—particularly those who felt that they were underemployed or who had enduring interpersonal difficulties with family or friends—were significantly more likely to catch colds than those who had only short-term stress.</p>

Stress increases cardiac output (i.e., the heart pumps more blood) at the same time that it reduces the ability of the blood vessels to conduct blood through the arteries, as the increase in levels of cortisol leads to a buildup of plaque on artery walls (Dekker et al., 2008).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_053">Dekker, M., Koper, J., van Aken, M., Pols, H., Hofman, A., de Jong, F.,…Tiemeier, H.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s03_p01">Not all people experience and respond to stress in the same way, and these differences can be important. The cardiologists Meyer Friedman and R. H. Rosenman (1974)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_060">Friedman, M., &amp; Rosenman, R. H. (1974). <em class="emphasis">Type A behavior and your heart</em>. New York, NY: Knopf.</span> were among the first to study the link between stress and heart disease. In their research, they noticed that even though the partners in married couples often had similar lifestyles, diet, and exercise patterns, the husbands nevertheless generally had more heart disease than did the wives. As they tried to explain the difference, they focused on the personality characteristics of the partners, finding that the husbands were more likely than the wives to respond to stressors with negative emotions and hostility.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s03_p02">Recent research has shown that the strongest predictor of a physiological stress response from daily hassles is the amount of negative emotion that they evoke. People who experience strong negative emotions as a result of everyday hassles and who respond to stress with hostility experience more negative health outcomes than do those who react in a less negative way (McIntyre, Korn, &amp; Matsuo, 2008; Suls &amp; Bunde, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_061">McIntyre, K., Korn, J., &amp; Matsuo, H.

The arousal that men experience when they are stressed leads them to either go on the attack, in an aggressive or revenging way, or else retreat as quickly as they can to safety from the stressor. The fight-or-flight response allows men to control the source of the stress if they think they can do so, or if that is not possible, it allows them to save face by leaving the situation. The fight-or-flight response is triggered in men by the activation of the HPA axis.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s03_p04">Women, on the other hand, are less likely to take a fight-or-flight response to stress. Rather, they are more likely to take a <em class="emphasis">tend-and-befriend response</em> (Taylor et al., 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_063">Taylor, S. E., Klein, L.

This approach is also self-protective because it allows the individual to talk to others about her concerns as well as to exchange resources, such as child care. The tend-and-befriend response is triggered in women by the release of the hormone <em class="emphasis">oxytocin</em>, which promotes affiliation. Overall, the tend-and-befriend response is healthier than the flight-or-flight response because it does not produce the elevated levels of arousal related to the HPA, including the negative results that accompany increased levels of cortisol. This may help explain why women, on average, have less heart disease and live longer than men.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s03_p05">The experience of long-term stress—and its potential negative impact on our physical and mental health—represents one example of the powerful influence of the social situation in our everyday lives. These findings represent social psychological principles in action: Our affect, cognition, and behavior are influenced in profound ways by the events that occur to us, and particularly by the people around us. Furthermore, the observed gender differences in response to stress demonstrate another example of the operation of the basic principles of social psychology: Men usually respond to stress by focusing on self-concern (fight or flight) whereas women are more likely to respond by focusing on other-concern (tend-and-befriend).</p>

C., McGonagle, K. A., Nelson, C. B., &amp; Hughes, M. (1994). Sex and depression in the National Comorbidity Survey: II. Cohort effects. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Affective Disorders, 30</em>(1), 15–26.</span> And many, many more people suffer from milder, but also harmful, forms of depression. Minor depression—the everyday negative mood or “blues” that most of us experience—is a part of everyday life for many people. It is no surprise that depression has been termed “the common cold of mental illness.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p02">Still another mental health outcome that relates to social behavior is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">anxiety</a><span class="glossdef">A psychological disorder that may be accompanied by a number of physical symptoms, including diarrhea, upset stomach, sweaty hands, shortness of breath, poor concentration, and general agitation.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">a psychological disorder that may be accompanied by a number of physical symptoms, including diarrhea, upset stomach, sweaty hands, shortness of breath, poor concentration, and general agitation</em>. As with depression, anxiety may be severe in some cases for some people, but it can also occur in more subtle, minor, and yet nevertheless troubling forms for many people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p03">Anxiety and depression have many causes. These syndromes are partially genetically inherited and are also determined in part by body chemicals including hormones and neurotransmitters. Nevertheless, depression and anxiety are also largely socially determined, and social psychologists naturally focus on these aspects. To a social psychologist, depression and anxiety are maladies that are caused by our everyday social lives and that can be understood and treated—at least in part—in a social sense.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p04">Depression and anxiety are caused at least partly by the lack of adequate social interactions. Almost half of Americans describe themselves as being shy. Shy people frequently find it difficult to make friends because they evaluate themselves negatively and feel that they cannot succeed in social encounters (Cheek &amp; Melchior, 1990).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_065">Cheek, J. M., &amp; Melchior, L. A. (1990). Shyness, self-esteem, and self-consciousness. In <em class="emphasis">Handbook of social and evaluation anxiety</em> (pp. 47–82). New York, NY: Plenum Press.</span> Extremely shy people may become lonely, and loneliness is a risk factor for a large range of physical and mental health problems, including depression and anxiety (Cacioppo, Hawley, &amp; Berston, 2003; Christensen &amp; Kashy, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_066">Cacioppo, J. T., Hawley, L. C., &amp; Bernston, G. G. (2003). The anatomy of loneliness. <em class="emphasis">Current Directions in Psychological Science, 12</em>(3), 71–74; Christensen, P. N., &amp; Kashy, D. A. (1998). Perceptions of and by lonely people in initial social interaction. <em class="emphasis">Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 24</em>(3), 322–329.</span> Depressed people frequently tend to avoid social interactions altogether, whereas shy, anxious people tend to become uncomfortable in public and may overestimate how much people are focusing on them. On the other hand, people who are more extroverted (i.e., who enjoy making friends and being in social situations) are less depressed and have fewer health problems (Diener, Suh, Lucas, &amp; Smith, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_067">Diener, E., Suh, E. M., Lucas, R. E., &amp; Smith, H. L. (1999). Subjective well-being: Three decades of progress. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 125</em>(2), 276–302.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p05">Depression and anxiety are determined both by how we feel about our own performance and by our social interactions with others. We are more likely to feel good about ourselves when we perceive that we have adequate social interactions and that we are accepted and cared for by others—but we are more likely to feel poorly about ourselves when we perceive that we are not measuring up to the goals and standards that others find important. When we feel that there are discrepancies between our goals and the actual conditions in our lives, we feel more emotion (Carver &amp; Scheier, 1981).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_068">Carver, C. S., &amp; Scheier, M. F. (1981). <em class="emphasis">Attention and self-regulation: A control-theory approach to human behavior</em>. New York, NY: Springer-Verlag.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p06">Tory Higgins and his colleagues (Higgins, Bond, Klein, &amp; Strauman, 1986; Strauman &amp; Higgins, 1988)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_069">Higgins, E. T., Bond, R. N., Klein, R., &amp; Strauman, T. (1986). Self-discrepancies and emotional vulnerability: How magnitude, accessibility, and type of discrepancy influence affect. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51</em>(1), 5–15; Strauman, T. J., &amp; Higgins, E. T. (1988). Self-discrepancies as predictors of vulnerability to distinct syndromes of chronic emotional distress. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality, 56</em>(4), 685–707.</span> have proposed that the types of emotional distress we experience are determined by both our perceptions of how well our own behaviors meet the standards and goals we have provided ourselves (our internal standards) and our perceptions of how others think about us (our external standards). Higgins found in his research that people were more likely to experience sadness, dissatisfaction, and other depression-related emotions when they indicated that their current perception of themselves (the actual self-concept) was discrepant with their hopes and goals (the ideal self-concept). But people were more likely to experience fear, worry, tension, and other anxiety-related emotions when they felt that the actual self-concept was discrepant with their beliefs about important standards regarding duty and obligations (the ought self-concept).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p07">Higgins also found in his research that the same negative emotions resulted when there were discrepancies between the actual self-concept and the ideal self-concept or the ought self-concept provided by other important people, such as parents and friends. That is, the participants felt bad about themselves when they did not meet the goals that other people thought were important (the external standards), just as they felt bad about not meeting their own goals (the internal standards). You might not care that much yourself about achieving in school or meeting your family obligations, but your failure to meet these goals may still produce negative emotions because you realize that your parents do think it is important. Again, the importance of the social situation in creating emotional experience is clear.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p08">As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_f01">Figure 3.7 "The Self-Fulfilling Nature of Anxiety and Depression"</a>, still another social aspect of anxiety and depression is that they are contagious and self-fulfilling. When we are depressed or anxious, these feelings show up in our behavior. Other people then see our negative states, and they are likely to respond to us negatively. These responses make it more difficult for us to do well in school and at work and lead to negative outcomes. For instance, people who are depressed or anxious are more likely to be divorced and fired from their jobs and are less fun to be around (Coyne &amp; Downey, 1991).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_070">Coyne, J. C., &amp; Downey, G. (1991). Social factors and psychopathology: Stress, social support, and coping processes. <em class="emphasis">Annual Review of Psychology, 42</em>, 401–425.</span> And these negative outcomes naturally create even more negative cognitions and more negative affect, which in turn make us feel even worse about ourselves.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p09">Given the social determinants of depression and anxiety, it will probably not surprise you to hear that one of the more important approaches to reducing anxiety and depression is to attempt to change our social cognitions and to help us improve our social interactions with others. Many current psychological therapies used to help alleviate depression and anxiety are designed to change the thought processes and the social interactions of individuals with psychological difficulties (Ellis, 2004; Beck, Freeman, &amp; Davis, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_071">Ellis, A.
