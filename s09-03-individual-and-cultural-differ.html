    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_p01">To this point, we have focused on how the appearance, behaviors, and traits of the people we encounter influence our understanding of them. It makes sense that this would be our focus because of the emphasis within social psychology on the social situation—in this case, the people we are judging. But the person is also important, so let’s consider some of the person variables that influence how we judge other people.</p>
    <div class="section" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Perceiver Characteristics</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p01">So far, we have assumed that different perceivers will all form pretty much the same impression of the same person. For instance, if you and I are both thinking about our friend Janetta, or describing her to someone else, we should each think about or describe her in pretty much the same way—after all, Janetta is Janetta, and she should have a personality that you and I can both see. But this is not always the case—you and I may form different impressions of Janetta, and for a variety of reasons. For one, my experiences with Janetta are somewhat different than yours. I see her in different places and talk to her about different things than you do, and thus I will have a different sample of behavior on which to base my impressions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p02">But you and I might even form different impressions of Janetta if we see her performing exactly the same behavior. To every experience, each of us brings our own schemas, attitudes, and expectations. In fact, the process of interpretation guarantees that we will not all form exactly the same impression of the people that we see. This, of course, reflects a basic principle that we have discussed throughout this book—our prior experiences color our current perceptions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p03">One perceiver factor that influences how we perceive others is the current <em class="emphasis">cognitive accessibility</em> of a given person characteristic—that is, the extent to which a person characteristic quickly and easily comes to mind for the perceiver. Differences in accessibility will lead different people to attend to different aspects of the other person. Some people first notice how attractive someone is because they care a lot about physical appearance—for them, appearance is a highly accessible characteristic. Others pay more attention to a person’s race or religion, and still others attend to a person’s height or weight. If you are interested in style and fashion, you would probably first notice a person’s clothes, whereas another person might be more likely to notice one’s athletic skills.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p04">You can see that these differences in accessibility will influence the kinds of impressions that we form about others because they influence what we focus on and how we think about them. In fact, when people are asked to describe others, there is often more overlap in the descriptions provided by the same perceiver about <em class="emphasis">different</em> people than there is in those provided by different perceivers about the <em class="emphasis">same</em> target person (Dornbusch, Hastorf, Richardson, Muzzy, &amp; Vreeland, 1965; Park, 1986).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_079">Dornbusch, S.

(1986). A method for studying the development of impressions of real people. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51</em>(5), 907–917.</span> If you care a lot about fashion, you will describe all your friends on that dimension, whereas if I care about athletic skills, I will tend to describe all my friends on the basis of their athletic qualities. These differences reflect the differing emphasis that we as observers place on the characteristics of others rather than the real differences between those people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p05">People also differ in terms of how carefully they process information about others. Some people have a strong need to think about and understand others. I’m sure you know people like this—they want to know why something went wrong or right, or just to know more about anyone with whom they interact. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Need for cognition</a><span class="glossdef">An individual difference measure of the tendency to think carefully and fully about people and situations.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">the tendency to think carefully and fully about social situations</em> (Cacioppo &amp; Petty, 1982).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_080">Cacioppo, J. T., &amp; Petty, R. E. (1982). The need for cognition. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 42</em>, 116–131.</span> People with a strong need for cognition tend to process information more thoughtfully and therefore may make more causal attributions overall. In contrast, people without a strong need for cognition tend to be more impulsive and impatient and may make attributions more quickly and spontaneously (Sargent, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_081">Sargent, M. (2004). Less thought, more punishment: Need for cognition predicts support for punitive responses to crime. <em class="emphasis">Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 30</em>(11), 1485–1493. doi: 10.1177/0146167204264481</span> Although the need for cognition refers to a tendency to think carefully and fully about any topic, there are also individual differences in the tendency to be interested in people more specifically. For instance, Fletcher, Danilovics, Fernandez, Peterson, and Reeder (1986)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_082">Fletcher, G. J. O., Danilovics, P., Fernandez, G., Peterson, D., &amp; Reeder, G. D. (1986). Attributional complexity: An individual differences measure. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51</em>(4), 875–884.</span> found that psychology majors were more curious about people than were natural science majors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p06">Individual differences exist not only in the depth of our attributions but also in the types of attributions we tend to make about both ourselves and others (Plaks, Levy, &amp; Dweck, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_083">Plaks, J. E., Levy, S. R., &amp; Dweck, C. S. (2009).

We call these people <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">entity theorists</a><span class="glossdef">People who tend to focus on the traits of other people and who tend to make a lot of personal attributions for the behavior of others.</span></span>. Entity theorists tend to focus on the traits of other people and tend to make a lot of personal attributions. On the other hand, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">incremental theorists</a><span class="glossdef">People who believe that personalities tend to change over time and who therefore are more likely to make situational attributions for events.</span></span> are those <em class="emphasis">who believe that personalities change a lot over time and who therefore are more likely to make situational attributions for events</em>. Incremental theorists are more focused on the dynamic psychological processes that arise from individuals’ changing mental states in different situations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p07">In one relevant study, Molden, Plaks, and Dweck (2006)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_084">Molden, D. C., Plaks, J. E., &amp; Dweck, C. S. (2006). “Meaningful” social inferences: Effects of implicit theories on inferential processes. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 42</em>(6), 738–752.</span> found that when forced to make judgments quickly, people who had been classified as entity theorists were nevertheless still able to make personal attributions about others but were not able to easily encode the situational causes of a behavior. On the other hand, when forced to make judgments quickly, the people who were classified as incremental theorists were better able to make use of the situational aspects of the scene than the personalities of the actors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p08">Individual differences in attributional styles can also influence our own behavior. Entity theorists are more likely to have difficulty when they move on to new tasks because they don’t think that they will be able to adapt to the new challenges. Incremental theorists, on the other hand, are more optimistic and do better in such challenging environments because they believe that their personality can adapt to the new situation. You can see that these differences in how people make attributions can help us understand both how we think about ourselves and others and how we respond to our own social contexts (Malle, Knobe, O’Laughlin, Pearce, &amp; Nelson, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_085">Malle, B.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p09">Carol Dweck and her colleagues (Blackwell, Trzesniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2007)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_086">Blackwell, L.

Implicit theories of intelligence predict achievement across an adolescent transition: A longitudinal study and an intervention. <em class="emphasis">Child Development, 78</em>(1), 246–263.</span> tested whether the type of attributions students make about their own characteristics might influence their school performance. They assessed the attributional tendencies and the math performance of 373 junior high school students at a public school in New York City. When they first entered seventh grade, the students all completed a measure of attributional styles. Those who tended to agree with statements such as “You have a certain amount of intelligence, and you really can’t do much to change it” were classified as <em class="emphasis">entity theorists</em>, whereas those who agreed more with statements such as “You can always greatly change how intelligent you are” were classified as <em class="emphasis">incremental theorists</em>. Then the researchers measured the students’ math grades at the end of the fall and spring terms in seventh and eighth grades.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p10">As you can see in int the following figure, the researchers found that the students who were classified as incremental theorists improved their math scores significantly more than did the entity students. It seems that the incremental theorists really believed that they could improve their skills and were then actually able to do it. These findings confirm that how we think about traits can have a substantial impact on our own behavior.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Cultural Differences in Person Perception</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p01">As we have seen in many places in this book, the culture that we live in has a significant impact on the way we think about and perceive the world. And thus it is not surprising that people in different cultures would tend to think about people at least somewhat differently. One difference is between people from Western cultures (e.g., the United States, Canada, and Australia) and people from East Asian cultures (e.g., Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, and India). People from Western cultures tend to be primarily oriented toward individualism, tending to think about themselves as different from (and often better than) the other people in their environment and believing that other people make their own decisions and are responsible for their own actions. In contrast, people in many East Asian cultures take a more collectivistic view of people that emphasizes not so much the individual but rather the relationship between individuals and the other people and things that surround them. The outcome of these differences is that on average, people from individualistic cultures tend to focus more on the individual person, whereas, again on average, people from collectivistic cultures tend to focus more on the situation (Ji, Peng, &amp; Nisbett, 2000; Lewis, Goto, &amp; Kong, 2008; Maddux &amp; Yuki, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_088">Ji, L.-J., Peng, K., &amp; Nisbett, R. E. (2000). Culture, control, and perception of relationships in the environment. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78</em>(5), 943–955; Lewis, R. S., Goto, S.

The “ripple effect”: Cultural differences in perceptions of the consequences of events. <em class="emphasis">Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 32</em>(5), 669–683.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p02">In one study demonstrating this difference, Miller (1984)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_089">Miller, J. G. (1984). Culture and the development of everyday social explanation. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 46</em>(5), 961–978.</span> asked children and adults in both India (a collectivist culture) and the United States (an individualist culture) to indicate the causes of negative actions by other people. Although the youngest children (ages 8 and 11) did not differ, the older children (age 15) and the adults did—Americans made more personal attributions, whereas Indians made more situational attributions for the same behavior.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p03">Masuda and Nisbett (2001)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_090">Masuda, T., &amp; Nisbett, R. E. (2001). Attending holistically versus analytically: Comparing the context sensitivity of Japanese and Americans. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81</em>(5), 922–934.</span> asked American and Japanese students to describe what they saw in images like the one shown in <a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_f01">Figure 6.7 "Cultural Differences in Perception"</a>. They found that while both groups talked about the most salient objects (the fish, which were brightly colored and swimming around), the Japanese students also tended to talk and remember more about the images in the background—they remembered the frog and the plants as well as the fish.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p04">Michael Morris and his colleagues (Hong, Morris, Chiu, &amp; Benet-Martínez, 2000)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_091">Hong, Y.-Y., Morris, M. W., Chiu, C.-Y., &amp; Benet-Martínez, V. (2000). Multicultural minds: A dynamic constructivist approach to culture and cognition. <em class="emphasis">American Psychologist, 55</em>(7), 709–720.</span> investigated the role of culture on person perception in a different way, by focusing on people who are bicultural (i.e., who have knowledge about two different cultures). In their research, they used high school students living in Hong Kong. Although traditional Chinese values are emphasized in Hong Kong, because Hong Kong was a British-administrated territory for more than a century, the students there are also acculturated with Western social beliefs and values.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p05">Morris and his colleagues first randomly assigned the students to one of three priming conditions. Participants in the <em class="emphasis">American culture</em> priming condition saw pictures of American icons (such as the U.S. Capitol building and the American flag) and then wrote 10 sentences about American culture. Participants in the <em class="emphasis">Chinese culture</em> priming condition saw eight Chinese icons (such as a Chinese dragon and the Great Wall of China) and then wrote 10 sentences about Chinese culture. Finally, participants in the <em class="emphasis">control condition</em> saw pictures of natural landscapes and wrote 10 sentences about the landscapes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p06">Then participants in all conditions read a story about an overweight boy who was advised by a physician not to eat food with high sugar content. One day, he and his friends went to a buffet dinner where a delicious-looking cake was offered. Despite its high sugar content, he ate it. After reading the story, the participants were asked to indicate the extent to which the boy’s weight problem was caused by his personality (personal attribution) or by the situation (situational attribution). The students who had been primed with symbols about American culture gave relatively less weight to situational (rather than personal) factors in comparison with students who had been primed with symbols of Chinese culture.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p07">In still another test of cultural differences in person perception, Kim and Markus (1999)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_092">Kim, H., &amp; Markus, H. R. (1999). Deviance or uniqueness, harmony or conformity? A cultural analysis. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77</em>(4), 785–800.</span> analyzed the statements made by athletes and by the news media regarding the winners of medals in the 2000 and 2002 Olympic Games. They found that athletes in China described themselves more in terms of the situation (they talked about the importance of their coaches, their managers, and the spectators in helping them to do well), whereas American athletes (can you guess?) focused on themselves, emphasizing their own strength, determination, and focus.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p08">Taken together then, we can see that cultural and individual differences play a similar role in person perception as they do in other social psychological areas. Although most people tend to use the same basic person-perception processes, and although we can understand these processes by observing the communalities among people, the outcomes of person perception will also be determined—at least in part—by the characteristics of the person himself or herself. And these differences are often created by the culture in which the person lives.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Attributional Styles and Mental Health</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p01">As we have seen in this chapter, how we make attributions about other people has a big influence on our reactions to them. But we also make attributions for our own behaviors. Social psychologists have discovered that there are important individual differences in the attributions that people make to the negative events that they experience and that these attributions can have a big influence on how they respond to them. The same negative event can create anxiety and depression in one individual but have virtually no effect on someone else. And still another person may see the negative event as a challenge to try even harder to overcome the difficulty (Blascovich &amp; Mendes, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_093">Blascovich, J., &amp; Mendes, W.

New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p02">A major determinant of how we react to perceived threats is the attributions that we make to them. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Attributional style</a><span class="glossdef">The type of attributions that people tend to make for the events that occur to them.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">the type of attributions that we tend to make for the events that occur to us</em>. These attributions can be to our own characteristics (<em class="emphasis">internal</em>) or to the situation (<em class="emphasis">external</em>), but attributions can also be made on other dimensions, including <em class="emphasis">stable</em> versus <em class="emphasis">unstable</em>, and <em class="emphasis">global</em> versus <em class="emphasis">specific</em>. <em class="emphasis">Stable attributions</em> are those that we think will be relatively permanent, whereas <em class="emphasis">unstable attributions</em> are expected to change over time. <em class="emphasis">Global attributions</em> are those that we feel apply broadly, whereas <em class="emphasis">specific</em> attributions are those causes that we see as more unique to specific events.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p03">You may know some people who tend to make negative or pessimistic attributions to negative events that they experience—we say that these people have a <em class="emphasis">negative attributional style</em>. These people explain negative events by referring to their own internal, stable, and global qualities. People with negative attributional styles say things such as the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>“I failed because I am no good” (<em class="emphasis">an internal attribution</em>).</li>
            <li>“I always fail” (<em class="emphasis">a stable attribution</em>).</li>
            <li>“I fail in everything” (<em class="emphasis">a global attribution</em>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p04">You might well imagine that the result of these negative attributional styles is a sense of hopelessness and despair (Metalsky, Joiner, Hardin, &amp; Abramson, 1993).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_094">Metalsky, G.

Similarly, some people who were exposed to bursts of noise later failed to stop the noise when they were actually able to do so. In short, learned helplessness is the tendency to make external, rather than internal, attributions for our behaviors. Those who experience learned helplessness do not feel that they have any control over their own outcomes and are more likely to have a variety of negative health outcomes (Henry, 2005; Peterson &amp; Seligman, 1984).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_097">Henry, P.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p06">Another type of attributional technique that people sometimes use to help them feel better about themselves is known as <em class="emphasis">self-handicapping.</em> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Self-handicapping</a><span class="glossdef">Making statements or engaging in behaviors that help us create a convenient external attribution for potential failure.</span></span> <em class="emphasis">occurs when we make statements or engage in behaviors that help us create a convenient external attribution for potential failure</em>. For instance, in research by Berglas and Jones (1978),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_098">Berglas, S., &amp; Jones, E. E. (1978). Drug choice as a self-handicapping strategy in response to noncontingent success. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 36</em>(4), 405–417.</span> participants first performed an intelligence test on which they did very well. It was then explained to them that the researchers were testing the effects of different drugs on performance and that they would be asked to take a similar but potentially more difficult intelligence test while they were under the influence of one of two different drugs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p07">The participants were then given a choice—they could take a pill that was supposed to facilitate performance on the intelligence task (making it easier for them to perform) or a pill that was supposed to inhibit performance on the intelligence task, thereby making the task harder to perform (no drugs were actually administered). Berglas found that men—but not women—engaged in self-handicapping: They preferred to take the performance-inhibiting rather than the performance-enhancing drug, choosing the drug that provided a convenient external attribution for potential failure.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p08">Although women may also self-handicap, particularly by indicating that they are unable to perform well due to stress or time constraints (Hirt, Deppe, &amp; Gordon, 1991),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_099">Hirt, E. R., Deppe, R. K., &amp; Gordon, L. J. (1991). Self-reported versus behavioral self-handicapping: Empirical evidence for a theoretical distinction. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 61</em>(6), 981–991.</span> men seem to do it more frequently. This is consistent with the general gender differences we have talked about in many places in this book—on average, men are more concerned about maintaining their self-esteem and social status in the eyes of themselves and others than are women.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p09">You can see that there are some benefits (but also, of course, some costs) of self-handicapping. If we fail after we self-handicap, we simply blame the failure on the external factor. But if we succeed despite the handicap that we have created for ourselves, we can make clear internal attributions for our success. But engaging in behaviors that create self-handicapping can be costly because they make it harder for us to succeed. In fact, research has found that people who report that they self-handicap regularly show lower life satisfaction, less competence, poorer moods, less interest in their jobs, and even more substance abuse (Zuckerman &amp; Tsai, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_100">Zuckerman, M., &amp; Tsai, F.-F. (2005). Costs of self-handicapping. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality, 73</em>(2), 411–442.</span> Although self-handicapping would seem to be useful for insulating our feelings from failure, it is not a good tack to take in the long run.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p10">Fortunately, not all people have such negative attributional styles. In fact, most people tend to have more positive ones—styles that are related to high positive self-esteem and a tendency to explain the negative events they experience by referring to external, unstable, and specific qualities. Thus people with positive attributional styles are likely to say things such as the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_l02">
            <li>“I failed because the task is very difficult” (<em class="emphasis">an external attribution</em>).</li>
            <li>“I will do better next time” (<em class="emphasis">an unstable attribution</em>).</li>
            <li>“I failed in this domain, but I’m good in other things” (<em class="emphasis">a specific attribution</em>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p11">In sum, we can say that people who make more positive attributions toward the negative events that they experience will persist longer at tasks and that this persistence can help them. But there are limits to the effectiveness of these strategies. We cannot control everything, and trying to do so can be stressful. We can change some things but not others; thus sometimes the important thing is to know when it’s better to give up, stop worrying, and just let things happen. Having a positive outlook is healthy, but we cannot be unrealistic about what we can and cannot do. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Unrealistic optimism</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency to be overly positive about the likelihood that negative things will occur to us and that we will be able to effectively cope with them if they do.</span></span> is the <em class="emphasis">tendency to be overly positive about the likelihood that negative things will occur to us and that we will be able to effectively cope with them if they do</em>. When we are too optimistic, we may set ourselves up for failure and depression when things do not work out as we had hoped (Weinstein &amp; Klein, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_101">Weinstein, N. D., &amp; Klein, W. M. (1996). Unrealistic optimism: Present and future. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 15</em>(1), 1–8.</span> We may think that we are immune to the potential negative outcomes of driving while intoxicated or practicing unsafe sex, but these optimistic beliefs are not healthy. Fortunately, most people have a reasonable balance between optimism and realism (Taylor &amp; Armor, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_102">Taylor, S. E., &amp; Armor, D. A.

Research has found that setting reasonable goals and feeling that we are moving toward them makes us happy, even if we may not in fact attain the goals themselves (Lawrence, Carver, &amp; Scheier, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_103">Lawrence, J.

                <li>Because we each use our own expectations in judgment, people may form different impressions of the same person performing the same behavior.</li>
                <li>Individual differences in the cognitive accessibility of a given personal characteristic may lead to more overlap in the descriptions provided by the same perceiver about different people than there is in those provided by different perceivers about the same target person.</li>
                <li>People with a strong need for cognition make more causal attributions overall. Entity theorists tend to focus on the traits of other people and tend to make a lot of personal attributions, whereas incremental theorists tend to believe that personalities change a lot over time and therefore are more likely to make situational attributions for events.</li>
                <li>People from Western cultures tend to make more personal attributions, whereas people from collectivistic cultures tend to focus more on the situational explanations of behavior.</li>
                <li>Individual differences in attributional styles can influence how we respond to the negative events that we experience.</li>
                <li>People who have extremely negative attributional styles, in which they continually make external, stable, and global attributions for their behavior, are said to be experiencing learned helplessness</li>
                <li>Self-handicapping is an attributional technique that prevents us from making ability attributions for our own failures.</li>
                <li>Having a positive outlook is healthy, but it must be tempered. We cannot be unrealistic about what we can and cannot do.</li>
