    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_p01">Human beings have very large brains and highly developed cognitive capacities. Thus it will come as no surprise that we meet the challenges that we face in everyday life largely by thinking about them and then planning what to do about them. Over time, people develop a huge amount of knowledge about the self, other people, social relationships, and social groups. This knowledge guides our responses to the people we interact with every day.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Our Knowledge Accumulates as a Result of Learning</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p01">People have many memories about their experiences with other people, and they use this information to make predictions about what people will do in the future. This knowledge is gained through learning. The study of learning is closely associated with the behaviorist school of psychology, which includes the psychologists John B. Watson and B. F. Skinner. For behaviorists, the fundamental aspect of learning is the process of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conditioning</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to connect stimuli (the changes that occur in the environment) with responses (behaviors or other actions).</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">the ability to connect stimuli (the changes that occur in the environment) with responses (behaviors or other actions)</em>. The behaviorists described two types of conditioning that are particularly important in behaviorism: <em class="emphasis">operant conditioning</em> (also known as <em class="emphasis">instrumental conditioning)</em> and <em class="emphasis">classical conditioning</em> (also known as <em class="emphasis">respondent conditioning</em>). When applied to human behavior, these two processes are frequently called, respectively, <em class="emphasis">operant learning</em> and <em class="emphasis">associational learning</em>.</p>
        <div class="section" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Operant Learning</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s01_p01">If a child touches a hot radiator, she quickly learns that the radiator is dangerous and is not likely to touch it again. If we have unpleasant experiences with people from a certain state or country, or a positive relationship with a person who has blonde hair or green eyes, we may develop negative or positive attitudes about people with these particular characteristics and attempt to reduce or increase our interactions with them. These changes in our understanding of our environments represent <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">operant learning</a><span class="glossdef">The principle that experiences that are followed by positive emotions (reinforcements or rewards) are likely to be repeated, whereas experiences that are followed by negative emotions (punishments) are less likely to be repeated.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">the principle that we learn new information as a result of the consequences of our behavior</em>. According to operant learning principles, experiences that are followed by positive emotions (reinforcements or rewards) are likely to be repeated, whereas experiences that are followed by negative emotions (punishments) are less likely to be repeated. In operant learning, the person learns from the consequences of his or her own actions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s01_p02">Although its principles are very simple, operant learning is probably the most important form of human learning. Operant learning occurs when a schoolroom bully threatens his classmates because doing so allows him to get his way, when a child gets good grades because her parents threaten to punish her if she doesn’t, when we begin to like someone who smiles at us frequently, and in hundreds of other cases every day. Operant learning can also be used to explain how people learn complex behaviors, such as how to read, and to understand complex social behaviors, such as the development of social norms and culture.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s01_p03">The application of operant learning to social psychology is straightforward: How do we know which behaviors are most appropriate in a social situation? We learn, in part, because we have positively reinforced for engaging in the appropriate ones and negatively reinforced for engaging in the inappropriate ones. It does not take us long to learn that Margette is more likely to give us the kiss we have been hoping for if we are nice to her or that our children are more likely to share their toys with others if we reward them for doing it. Operant learning has even been used to explain why some people choose to become criminals. According to this approach, criminal behavior is determined by the reinforcements and punishments that the individual experiences (e.g., with peers and with parents) as a result of his or her behavior (Akers, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_003">Akers, R.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Associational Learning</h2>

We may enjoy smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee, and eating not only because they give us pleasure themselves but also because they have been associated with pleasant social experiences in the past.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p02">Associational learning also influences our knowledge and judgments about other people. For instance, research has shown that people view men and women who are seen alongside other people who are attractive, or who are said to have attractive girlfriends or boyfriends, more favorably than they do the same people who are seen alongside more average-looking others (Sigall &amp; Landy, 1973).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_004">Sigall, H., &amp; Landy, D. (1973). Radiating beauty: Effects of having a physically attractive partner on person perception. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 28</em>(2), 218–224.</span> This liking is due to associational learning—we have positive feelings toward the people simply because those people are associated with the positive features of the attractive others.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p03">Associational learning has long been, and continues to be, an effective tool in marketing and advertising (Hawkins, Best, &amp; Coney, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_005">Hawkins, D., Best, R., &amp; Coney, K. (1998.) <em class="emphasis">Consumer behavior: Building marketing strategy</em> (7th ed.). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill</span> The general idea is to create an advertisement that has positive features so that it creates enjoyment in the person exposed to it. Because the product being advertised is mentioned in the ad, it becomes associated with the positive feelings that the ad creates. In the end, if everything has gone well, seeing the product online or in a store will then create a positive response in the buyer, leading him or her to be more likely to purchase the product.</p>

                <p class="para">Can you determine how associational learning is being used in these ads?</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p04">A similar strategy is used by corporations that sponsor teams or events. For instance, if people enjoy watching a college basketball team playing basketball, and if that team is sponsored by a product, such as Pepsi, then people may end up experiencing positive feelings when they view a can of Pepsi. Of course, the sponsor wants to sponsor only good teams and good athletes because these create more pleasurable responses.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p05">Advertisers use a variety of techniques to create positive advertisements, including enjoyable music, cute babies, attractive models, and funny spokespeople. In one study, Gorn (1982)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_006">Gorn, G. J. (1982). The effects of music in advertising on choice behavior: A classical conditioning approach. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Marketing, 46</em>(1), 94–101.</span> showed research participants pictures of writing pens of different colors, but paired one of the pens with pleasant music and another with unpleasant music. When given a choice as a free gift, more people chose the pen that had been associated with the pleasant music. In another study, Schemer, Matthes, Wirth, and Textor (2008)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_007">Schemer, C., Matthes, J. R., Wirth, W., &amp; Textor, S. (2008). Does “passing the Courvoisier” always pay off? Positive and negative evaluative conditioning effects of brand placements in music videos. <em class="emphasis">Psychology &amp; Marketing, 25</em>(10), 923–943.</span> found that people were more interested in products that had been embedded in music videos of artists that they liked and less likely to be interested when the products were in videos featuring artists that they did not like.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p06">Another type of ad that is based on principles of classical conditioning is one that associates fear with the use of a product or behavior, such as those that show pictures of deadly automobile accidents to encourage seatbelt use or images of lung cancer surgery to discourage smoking. These ads have also been found to be effective (Das, de Wit, &amp; Stroebe, 2003; Perloff, 2003; Witte &amp; Allen, 2000),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_008">Das, E. H. H.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p08">Taken together then, research studies provide ample evidence of the utility of associational learning in advertising, in ads using positive stimuli and in those using negative stimuli. This does not mean, however, that we are always influenced by these ads. The likelihood that associational learning will be successful is greater when we do not know much about the products, where the differences between products are relatively minor, and when we do not think too carefully about the choices (Schemer et al., 2008).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_009">Schemer, C., Matthes, J. R., Wirth, W., &amp; Textor, S. (2008). Does “passing the Courvoisier” always pay off?

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p09">Associational learning is also implicated in the development of unfair and unjustified racial prejudices. We may dislike people from certain racial or ethnic groups because we frequently see them portrayed in the media as associated with violence, drug use, or terrorism. And we may avoid people with certain physical characteristics simply because they remind us of other people we do not like.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p10">Lewicki (1985)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_010">Lewicki, P. (1985). Nonconscious biasing effects of single instances on subsequent judgments. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 48</em>, 563–574.</span> conducted research that demonstrated the influence of associational learning and how quickly and easily such learning can happen. In his experiment, high school students first had a brief interaction with a female experimenter who had short hair and wore glasses. The study was set up so that the students had to ask the experimenter a question, and (according to random assignment) the experimenter responded in either a negative way or a neutral way toward the participants. Then the students were told to go into a second room in which two experimenters were present and to approach either one of them. The researchers arranged it so that one of the two experimenters looked a lot like the original experimenter and the other one did not (she had longer hair and did not wear glasses). The students were significantly more likely to avoid the experimenter who looked like the original experimenter when that experimenter had been negative to them than when she had treated them neutrally. As a result of associational learning, the negative behavior of the first experimenter unfairly “rubbed off” onto the second.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p11">Donal Carlston and his colleagues (Mae &amp; Carlston, 2005; Skowronski, Carlston, Mae, &amp; Crawford, 1998)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_011">Mae, L., &amp; Carlston, D.

Spontaneous trait transference: Communicators take on the qualities they describe in others. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74</em>(4), 837–848.</span> discovered still another way that associational learning can occur: When we say good or bad things about another person in public, the people who hear us say these things associate those characteristics with us, such that they like people who say positive things and dislike people who say negative things. The moral is clear—associational learning is powerful, so be careful what you do and say.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s03_p03">For some of the children, the female model was shown being rewarded for engaging in the behavior, and for other children, she was punished. In support of the principles of operant learning, Bandura’s study found that the children were more likely to be aggressive when the model had been rewarded for the behavior and were less likely to be so when the model had been punished. But even the children who did not see the model receive any reward nevertheless imitated the behavior to some extent. One of the major contributions of this study is the demonstration that children learned new types of aggressive behaviors simply by observing and imitating others.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s03_p04">Observational learning is involved in much of our learning about our social worlds. Observational learning teaches us that Hank is friendly, that Joanna is selfish, and that Frankie has a crush on Malik. In other cases, our knowledge comes more indirectly, from what we read in books or see on TV, or from what our friends tell us, for instance.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s03_p05">Observational learning is useful because it allows people to learn without having to actually engage in what might be a risky behavior. As Bandura put it,</p>

For this reason, one does not teach children to swim, adolescents to drive automobiles, and novice medical students to perform surgery by having them discover the appropriate behavior through the consequences of their successes and failures. The more costly and hazardous the possible mistakes, the heavier is the reliance on observational learning from competent learners.

For instance, if you have watched Italian movies or if you have visited Italy, you might have come to the conclusion that Italians frequently gesture a lot with their hands when they talk—that they are quite expressive. This knowledge will be contained in your group schema about Italians. Therefore, when you meet someone who is Italian, or even when you meet someone who reminds you of an Italian person, you may well expect that they will gesture when they talk.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s01_p02">Having a database of social knowledge to draw on is obviously extremely useful. If we didn’t know or couldn’t remember anything about anyone or about anything that we had encountered in the past, our life would be difficult indeed because we would continually have to start our learning over again. Our schemas allow us to better understand people and help us make sense of information, particularly when the information is unclear or ambiguous. They also allow us to “fill in the blanks” by making guesses about what other people are probably like or probably going to do in cases where things are uncertain. Furthermore, the fact that different people have different past experiences—and thus that their schemas and attitudes are different—helps explain why different people draw different conclusions about the same events.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s01_p03">Once they have developed, schemas influence our subsequent learning, such that the new people and situations we encounter are interpreted and understood in terms of our existing knowledge (Piaget &amp; Inhelder, 1966; Taylor &amp; Crocker, 1981).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_016">Piaget, J., and Inhelder, B.

Higgins, C. P. Herman, &amp; M. P. Zanna (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Social cognition: The Ontario symposium</em> (Vol. 1, pp. 89–134). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</span> Imagine, for instance, that you have a schema—and thus an expectation—that Italians are very expressive, and you now meet Bianca, who has arrived at your school directly from Rome, Italy. You immediately expect her to be outgoing and expressive. However, as you get to know Bianca, you discover that she is not at all expressive and does not “talk with her hands.” In fact, she is quite shy and reserved. How does existing information influence how we react to the new information that we receive?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s01_p04">One possibility is that the new information simply updates our existing expectations. We might decide, for instance, that there is more variation among Italians in terms of expressiveness than we had previously realized, and we might resolve that Italians can sometimes be very shy and thoughtful. Or perhaps we might note that although Bianca is Italian, she is also a woman. This might lead us change our schema such that we now believe that although Italian men are expressive, Italian women are not. <em class="emphasis">When existing schemas change on the basis of new information,</em> we call the process <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">accommodation</a><span class="glossdef">The process that occurs when existing schemas change on the basis of new information.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s01_p05">In other cases, however, we engage in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">assimilation</a><span class="glossdef">The process that occurs when existing knowledge influences new information in a way that makes the conflicting information fit with existing knowledge, thus reducing the likelihood of change.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a process in which our existing knowledge influences new conflicting information to better fit with our existing knowledge, thus reducing the likelihood of schema change</em>. If we used assimilation, instead of changing our expectations about Italians, we might try to reinterpret Bianca’s unexpected behavior to make it more consistent with our expectations. For instance, we might decide that Bianca’s behavior is actually more expressive than we thought it was at first, or that she is acting in a more shy and reserved manner because she is trying to impress us with her thoughtfulness or because she is not yet comfortable at the new school. Or we might assume that she is expressive at home with her family but not around us. In these cases, the process of assimilation has led us to process the new information about Bianca in a way that allows us to keep our existing expectations about Italians more generally intact.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s02_p01">As we have seen in our earlier discussion, accommodation (i.e., the changing of beliefs on the basis of new information) does occur—it is the process of learning itself. Our beliefs about Italians may well change through our encounters with Bianca. However, there are many factors that lead us to assimilate information to our expectations rather than to accommodate our expectations to fit new information. In fact, we can say that in most cases, once a schema is developed, it will be difficult to change it because the expectation leads us to process new information in ways that serve to strengthen it rather than to weaken it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s02_p02">The tendency toward assimilation is so strong that it has substantial effects on our everyday social cognition.

In this research, high school students were asked to read a set of 25 pairs of cards, in which each pair supposedly contained one real and one fake suicide note. The students’ task was to examine both cards and to decide which of the two notes was written by an actual suicide victim. After the participants read each card and made their decision, the experimenter told them whether their decision was correct or incorrect. However, the feedback was not at all based on the participants’ responses. Rather, the experimenters arranged the feedback so that, on the basis of random assignment, different participants were told either that they were successful at the task (they got 24 out of 25 correct), average at the task (they got 17 out of 25 correct), or poor at the task (they got 10 out of 25 correct), regardless of their actual choices.</p>
                <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p10">At this point, the experimenters stopped the experiment and completely explained to the participants what had happened, including how the feedback they had received was predetermined so that they would learn that they were either successful, average, or poor at the task. They were even shown the schedule that the experimenters had used to give them the feedback. Then the participants were asked, as a check on their reactions to the experiment, to indicate how many answers they thought they would get correct on a subsequent—and real—series of 25 card pairs.</p>
                <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p11">As you can see in the following figure, the results of this experiment showed a clear tendency for expectations to be maintained even in the face of information that should have discredited them. Students who had been told that they were successful at the task indicated that they thought they would get more responses correct in a real test of their ability than those who thought they were average at the task, and students who thought they were average thought they would do better than those told they were poor at the task. In short, once students had been convinced that they were either good or bad at the task, they really believed it. It then became very difficult to remove their beliefs, even by providing information that should have effectively done so.</p>

                <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s02_p03">Why do we tend to hold onto our beliefs rather than change them? One reason that our beliefs often outlive the evidence on which they are supposed to be based is that people come up with reasons to support their beliefs. People who learned that they were good at detecting real suicide notes probably thought of a lot of reasons why this might be the case—“Geez, I predicted that Suzy would break up with Billy” or “I knew that my Mom was going to be sad after I left for college”—whereas the people who learned that they were not good at the task probably thought of the opposite types of reasons—“I had no idea that Jean was going to drop out of high school.” You can see that these tendencies will produce assimilation—the interpretation of our experiences in ways that support our existing beliefs. Indeed, research has found that perhaps the only way to reduce our tendencies to assimilate information into our existing belief is to explicitly force people to think about exactly the opposite belief (Anderson &amp; Sechler, 1986).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_019">Anderson, C.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s02_p04">In some cases, our existing knowledge acts to direct our attention toward information that matches our expectations and prevents us from attempting to attend to or acknowledge conflicting information (Fiske &amp; Neuberg, 1990).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_020">Fiske, S.

P. Zanna (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Advances in experimental social psychology</em> (Vol. 23, pp. 1–74). New York, NY: Academic.</span> To return to our example of Bianca from Rome, when we first meet her, we may immediately begin to look for signs of expressiveness in her behavior and personality. Because we expect people to confirm our expectations, we frequently respond to new people as if we already know what they are going to be like. Yaacov Trope and Erik Thompson (1997)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_021">Trope, Y., &amp; Thompson, E. (1997). Looking for truth in all the wrong places?

Because we believe that Italians are expressive, we expect to see that behavior in Bianca, we preferentially attend to information that confirms those beliefs, and we tend to ignore any disconfirming information. The outcome is that our expectations resist change (Fazio, Ledbetter, &amp; Towles-Schwen, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_022">Fazio, R. H., Ledbetter, J.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s02_p05">Our reliance on schemas can also make it more difficult for us to “think outside the box.” Peter Wason (1960)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_023">Wason, P. (1960). On the failure to eliminate hypotheses in a conceptual task. <em class="emphasis">The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 12</em>(3), 129–140.</span> asked college students to determine the rule that was used to generate the numbers 2-4-6 by asking them to generate possible sequences and then telling them if those numbers followed the rule. The first guess that students made was usually “consecutive ascending even numbers,” and they then asked questions designed to confirm their hypothesis (“Does 102-104-106 fit?” “What about 434-436-438?”). Upon receiving information that those guesses did fit the rule, the students stated that the rule was “consecutive ascending even numbers.” But the students’ use of the confirmation bias led them to ask only about instances that confirmed their hypothesis and not about those that would disconfirm it. They never bothered to ask whether 1-2-3 or 3-11-200 would fit; if they had, they would have learned that the rule was not “consecutive ascending even numbers” but simply “any three ascending numbers.” Again, you can see that once we have a schema (in this case, a hypothesis), we continually retrieve that schema from memory rather than other relevant ones, leading us to act in ways that tend to confirm our beliefs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s02_p06">Because expectations influence what we attend to, they also influence what we remember. One frequent outcome is that information that confirms our expectations is more easily processed, is more easily understood, and thus has a bigger impact than does information that disconfirms our expectations. There is substantial research evidence indicating that when processing information about social groups, individuals tend to particularly remember information better that confirms their existing beliefs about those groups (Fyock &amp; Stangor, 1994; Van Knippenberg &amp; Dijksterhuis, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_024">Fyock, J., &amp; Stangor, C.

This of course strengthens and maintains our beliefs and produces even more assimilation. And our schemas may also be maintained because when people get together, they talk about other people in ways that tend to express and confirm existing beliefs (Ruscher &amp; Duval, 1998; Schaller &amp; Conway, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_025">Ruscher, J.

In their research, they gave participants a picture and some information about a fourth-grade girl named Hannah. To activate a schema about her social class, Hannah was pictured sitting in front of a nice suburban house for one half of the participants and was pictured in front of an impoverished house in an urban area for the other half. Then the participants watched a video that showed Hannah taking an intelligence test. As the test went on, Hannah got some of the questions right and some of them wrong, but the number of correct and incorrect answers was the same in both conditions. Then the participants were asked to remember how many questions Hannah got right and wrong. Demonstrating that stereotypes had influenced memory, the participants who thought that Hannah had come from an upper-class background judged that she had gotten more correct answers than those who thought she was from a lower-class background.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s02_p08">This is not to say that we only remember information that matches our expectations.

One day you discover, however, that he has taken some money from your wallet without getting your permission or even telling you. It is likely that this new information—because it is so personally involving and important—will have a dramatic effect on your perception of your friend and that you will remember it for a long time. In short, information that is either consistent with, or very inconsistent with, an existing schema or attitude is likely to be well remembered.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s02_p09">Still another way that our expectations tend to maintain themselves is by leading us to act toward others on the basis of our expectations, creating a <em class="emphasis">self-fulfilling prophecy</em>.

If I have a stereotype that Italians are fun, then I may act toward Bianca in a friendly way. My friendly behavior may be reciprocated by Bianca, and if many other people also engage in the same positive behaviors with her, in the long run she may actually become a friendlier person, thus confirming our initial expectations. Of course, the opposite is also possible—if I believe that short people are boring or that women are overly emotional, my behavior toward short people and women may lead me to maintain those more negative, and probably inaccurate, beliefs as well.</p>

Even if the individual is provided with evidence that suggests that he or she was wrong, that individual will likely assimilate that information to the existing belief.

In the research, participants were shown information describing the behaviors of people who supposedly belonged to different social groups, although the groups were actually fictitious and were labeled only as the “red group,” the “blue group,” the “yellow group,” and the “green group.” Each group engaged in behaviors that were primarily either honest, dishonest, intelligent, or unintelligent.

                    <li>Describe a time when you learned new information or new behaviors through operant, associational, or observational learning.</li>
                    <li>Think about a time when you made a snap judgment about another person. Did your expectations about people influence your judgment of this person? Was the judgment fair or unfair?</li>
                    <li>Consider some of your beliefs about the people you know. Were these beliefs formed through assimilation, accommodation, or a combination of both? Do you think that your expectations now influence how you respond to these people?</li>
                    <li>Describe a time when you might have unfairly used an expectation about another person. Did the expectation serve as an energy saver?</li>
