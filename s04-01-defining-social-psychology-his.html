Newspapers, websites, and other media frequently report the findings of social psychologists, and the results of social psychological research are influencing decisions in a wide variety of areas. Let’s begin with a short history of the field of social psychology and then turn to a review of the basic principles of the science of social psychology.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p01">The science of social psychology began when scientists first started to systematically and formally measure the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of human beings (Kruglanski &amp; Stroebe, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_001">Kruglanski, A., &amp; Stroebe, W.

The dynamogenic factors in pacemaking and competition. <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Psychology, 9</em>(4), 507–533.</span> and the first social psychology textbooks were published in 1908 (McDougall, 1908/2003; Ross, 1908/1974).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_003">McDougall, W.

New York, NY: Arno Press.</span> During the 1940s and 1950s, the social psychologists Kurt Lewin and Leon Festinger refined the experimental approach to studying behavior, creating social psychology as a rigorous scientific discipline. Lewin is sometimes known as “the father of social psychology” because he initially developed many of the important ideas of the discipline, including a focus on the dynamic interactions among people. In 1954, Festinger edited an influential book called <em class="emphasis">Research Methods in the Behavioral Sciences</em>, in which he and other social psychologists stressed the need to measure variables and to use laboratory experiments to systematically test research hypotheses about social behavior. He also noted that it might be necessary in these experiments to deceive the participants about the true nature of the research.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p03">Social psychology quickly expanded to study other topics. John Darley and Bibb Latané (1968)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_008">Darley, J. M., &amp; Latané, B. (1968). Bystander intervention in emergencies: Diffusion of responsibility. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 8</em>(4, Pt. 1), 377–383.</span> developed a model that helped explain when people do and do not help others in need, and Leonard Berkowitz (1974)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_009">Berkowitz, L. (1974). <em class="emphasis">Aggression: A social psychological analysis</em>. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</span> pioneered the study of human aggression. Meanwhile, other social psychologists, including Irving Janis (1972),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_010">Janis, I. L. (1972). <em class="emphasis">Victims of groupthink: A psychological study of foreign policy decisions and fiascos</em>. Boston, MA: Houghton-Mifflin.</span> focused on group behavior, studying why intelligent people sometimes made decisions that led to disastrous results when they worked together. Still other social psychologists, including Gordon Allport and Muzafir Sherif, focused on intergroup relations, with the goal of understanding and potentially reducing the occurrence of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination. Social psychologists gave their opinions in the 1954 <em class="emphasis">Brown v. Board of Education</em> Supreme Court case that helped end racial segregation in U.S. public schools, and social psychologists still frequently serve as expert witnesses on these and other topics (Fiske, Bersoff, Borgida, Deaux, &amp; Heilman, 1991).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_011">Fiske, S.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p04">The latter part of the 20th century saw an expansion of social psychology into the field of attitudes, with a particular emphasis on cognitive processes. During this time, social psychologists developed the first formal models of persuasion, with the goal of understanding how advertisers and other people could present their messages to make them most effective (Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993; Hovland, Janis, &amp; Kelley, 1963).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_012">Eagly, A.

(1963). <em class="emphasis">Communication and persuasion</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p05">In the 1970s and 1980s, social psychology became even more cognitive in orientation as social psychologists used advances in cognitive psychology, which were themselves based largely on advances in computer technology, to inform the field (Fiske &amp; Taylor, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_014">Fiske, S.

Tory Higgins, Richard Nisbett, Lee Ross, Shelley Taylor, and many others, was on <em class="emphasis">social cognition</em>—an understanding of how our knowledge about our social worlds develops through experience and the influence of these knowledge structures on memory, information processing, attitudes, and judgment. Furthermore, the extent to which humans’ decision making could be flawed by both cognitive and motivational processes was documented (Kahneman, Slovic, &amp; Tversky, 1982).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_015">Kahneman, D., Slovic, P., &amp; Tversky, A.

People are born with skills that allow them to successfully interact with others in their social world. Newborns are able to recognize faces and to respond to human voices, young children learn language and develop friendships with other children, adolescents become interested in sex and are destined to fall in love, most adults marry and have children, and most people usually get along with others.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p02">People have these particular characteristics because we have all been similarly shaped through human evolution. The genetic code that defines human beings has provided us with specialized social skills that are important to survival. Just as keen eyesight, physical strength, and resistance to disease helped our ancestors survive, so too did the tendency to engage in social behaviors. We quickly make judgments about other people, help other people who are in need, and enjoy working together in social groups because these behaviors helped our ancestors to adapt and were passed along on their genes to the next generation (Ackerman &amp; Kenrick, 2008; Barrett &amp; Kurzban, 2006; Pinker, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_017">Ackerman, J.

Fitter organisms pass on their genes more successfully to later generations, making the characteristics that produce fitness more likely to become part of the organisms’ nature than are characteristics that do not produce fitness. For example, it has been argued that the emotion of jealousy has survived over time in men because men who experience jealousy are more fit than men who do not. According to this idea, the experience of jealousy leads men to protect their mates and guard against rivals, which increases their reproductive success (Buss, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_020">Buss, D.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p05">Evolutionary adaption has provided us with two fundamental motivations that guide us and help us lead productive and effective lives.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Self-Concern</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s02_p01">The most basic tendency of all living organisms, and the focus of the first human motivation, is the desire to protect and enhance one’s own life and the lives of the people who are close to us. Humans are motivated to find food and water, to obtain adequate shelter, and to protect themselves from danger. Doing so is necessary because we can survive only if we are able to meet these fundamental goals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s02_p02">The desire to maintain and enhance the self also leads us to do the same for our relatives—those people who are genetically related to us. Human beings, like other animals, exhibit <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">kin selection</a><span class="glossdef">Strategies that favor the reproductive success of one’s relatives, sometimes at a cost to the survival of the individual.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">strategies that favor the reproductive success of one’s relatives, sometimes even at a cost to the individual’s own survival</em>. According to evolutionary principles, kin selection occurs because behaviors that enhance the fitness of relatives, even if they lower the fitness of the individual himself or herself, may nevertheless increase the survival of the group as a whole.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s02_p03">In addition to our kin, we desire to protect, improve, and enhance the well-being of our <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ingroup</a><span class="glossdef">Other people whom we view as being similar and important to us and with whom we share close social connections.</span></span>: <em class="emphasis">those whom we view as being similar and important to us and with whom we share close social connections</em>, even if those people do not actually share our genes. Perhaps you remember a time when you helped friends move all their furniture into a new apartment, even when you would have preferred to be doing something more beneficial for yourself, such as studying or relaxing. You wouldn’t have helped strangers in this way, but you did it for your friends because you felt close to and cared about them. The tendency to help the people we feel close to, even if they are not related to us, is probably due in part to our evolutionary past: The people we were closest to were usually those we were related to.</p>

We live together in communities, we work together in work groups, we may worship together in religious groups, and we may play together on sports teams and through clubs. Affiliating with other people—even strangers—helps us meet a fundamental goal: that of finding a romantic partner with whom we can have children. Our connections with others also provide us with other opportunities that we would not have on our own. We can go to the grocery to buy milk or eggs, and we can hire a carpenter to build a house for us. And we ourselves do work that provides goods and services for others. This mutual cooperation is beneficial both for us and for the people around us. We also affiliate because we enjoy being with others, being part of social groups, and contributing to social discourse (Leary &amp; Cox, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_021">Leary, M. R., &amp; Cox, C. B. (Eds.). (2008). <em class="emphasis">Belongingness motivation: A mainspring of social action</em>. New York, NY: Guilford Press.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s03_p02">What the other-concern motive means is that we do not always put ourselves first. Being human also involves caring about, helping, and cooperating with other people. Although our genes are themselves “selfish” (Dawkins, 2006),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_022">Dawkins, R. (2006). <em class="emphasis">The selfish gene.</em> Oxford, England: Oxford University Press.</span> this does not mean that individuals always are. The survival of our own genes may be improved by helping others, even those who are not related to us (Krebs, 2008; Park, Schaller, &amp; Van Vugt, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_023">Krebs, D. L. (2008). Morality: An evolutionary account. <em class="emphasis">Perspectives on Psychological Science, 3</em>(3), 149–172; Park, J. H., Schaller, M., &amp; Van Vugt, M. (2008). Psychology of human kin recognition: Heuristic cues, erroneous inferences, and their implications. <em class="emphasis">Review of General Psychology, 12</em>(3), 215–235.</span> Just as birds and other animals may give out alarm calls to other animals to indicate that a predator is nearby, humans engage in altruistic behaviors in which they help others, sometimes at a potential cost to themselves.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s03_p03">In short, human beings behave <em class="emphasis">morally</em> toward others—they understand that it is wrong to harm other people without a strong reason for doing so, and they display compassion and even altruism toward others (Goetz, Keltner, &amp; Simon-Thomas, 2010; Turiel, 1983).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_024">Goetz, J. L., Keltner, D., &amp; Simon-Thomas, E. (2010). Compassion: An evolutionary analysis and empirical review. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 136</em>(3), 351–374; Turiel, E. (1983). <em class="emphasis">The development of social knowledge: Morality and convention</em>. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.</span> As a result, negative behaviors toward others, such as bullying, cheating, stealing, and aggression, are unusual, unexpected, and socially disapproved. Of course this does not mean that people are always friendly, helpful, and nice to each other—powerful social situations can and do create negative behaviors. But the fundamental human motivation of other-concern does mean that hostility and violence are the exception rather than the rule of human behavior.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s03_p04">Sometimes the goals of self-concern and other-concern go hand in hand. When we fall in love with another person, it is in part about a concern for connecting with someone else but is also about self-concern—falling in love makes us feel good about ourselves. And when we volunteer to help others who are in need, it is in part for their benefit but also for us. We feel good when we help others. At other times, however, the goals of self-concern and other-concern conflict. Imagine that you are walking across campus and you see a man with a knife threatening another person. Do you intervene, or do you turn away? In this case, your desire to help the other person (other-concern) is in direct conflict with your desire to protect yourself from the danger posed by the situation (self-concern), and you must decide which goal to put first. We will see many more examples of the motives of self-concern and other-concern, both working together and working against each other, throughout this book.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Social Situation Creates Powerful Social Influence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_p01">When people are asked to indicate the things that they value the most, they usually mention their social situation—that is, their relationships with other people (Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995; Fiske &amp; Haslam, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_025">Baumeister, R., &amp; Leary, M. (1995). The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 117</em>, 497–529; Fiske, A. P., &amp; Haslam, N. (1996). Social cognition is thinking about relationships. <em class="emphasis">Current Directions in Psychological Science, 5</em>(5), 137–142.</span> When we work together on a class project, volunteer at a homeless shelter, or serve on a jury in a courtroom trial, we count on others to work with us to get the job done. We develop social bonds with those people, and we expect that they will come through to help us meet our goals. The importance of others shows up in every aspect of our lives—other people teach us what we should and shouldn’t do, what we should and shouldn’t think, and even what we should and shouldn’t like and dislike.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_p02">In addition to the people with whom we are currently interacting, we are influenced by people who are not physically present but who are nevertheless part of our thoughts and feelings. Imagine that you are driving home on a deserted country road late at night. No cars are visible in any direction, and you can see for miles. You come to a stop sign. What do you do? Most likely, you stop at the sign, or at least slow down. You do so because the behavior has been internalized: Even though no one is there to watch you, others are still influencing you—you’ve learned about the rules and laws of society, what’s right and what’s wrong, and you tend to obey them. We carry our own personal social situations—our experiences with our parents, teachers, leaders, authorities, and friends—around with us every day.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_p03">An important principle of social psychology, one that will be with us throughout this book, is that although individuals’ characteristics do matter, the social situation is often a stronger determinant of behavior than is personality. When social psychologists analyze an event such as a cult suicide, they are likely to focus more on the characteristics of the situation (e.g., the strong leader and the group pressure provided by the other group members) than on the characteristics of the cult members themselves. As an example, we will see that even ordinary people who are neither bad nor evil in any way can nevertheless be placed in situations in which an authority figure is able to lead them to engage in evil behaviors, such as applying potentially lethal levels of electrical shock (Milgram, 1974).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_026">Milgram, S. (1974). <em class="emphasis">Obedience to authority: An experimental view</em>. New York, NY: Harper &amp; Row.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_p04">In addition to discovering the remarkable extent to which our behavior is influenced by our social situation, social psychologists have discovered that we often do not recognize how important the social situation is in determining behavior. We often wrongly think that we and others act entirely on our own accord, without any external influences. It is tempting to assume that the people who commit extreme acts, such as terrorists or members of suicide cults, are unusual or extreme people. And yet much research suggests that these behaviors are caused more by the social situation than they are by the characteristics of the individuals and that it is wrong to focus so strongly on explanations of individuals’ characteristics (Gilbert &amp; Malone, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_027">Gilbert, D., &amp; Malone, P.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_n01_p03">In addition to having better mental health, people who have adequate social support are more physically healthy.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_n01_p04">The opposite of social support is the feeling of being excluded or ostracized. Feeling that others are excluding us is painful, and the pain of rejection may linger even longer than physical pain. People who were asked to recall an event that caused them social pain (e.g., betrayal by a person very close to them) rated the pain as more intense than they rated their memories of intense physical pain (Chen, Williams, Fitness, &amp; Newton, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_034">Chen, Z., Williams, K.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_n01_p05">Because connecting with others is such an important part of human experience, we may sometimes withhold affiliation from or ostracize other people in order to attempt to force them to conform to our wishes. When individuals of the Amish religion violate the rulings of an elder, they are placed under a <em class="emphasis">Meidung</em>. During this time, and until they make amends, they are not spoken to by community members. And people frequently use the “silent treatment” to express their disapproval of a friend’s or partner’s behavior. The pain of ostracism is particularly strong in adolescents (Sebastian, Viding, Williams, &amp; Blakemore, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_036">Sebastian, C., Viding, E., Williams, K.

Withholding social communication and interaction is a powerful weapon for punishing individuals and forcing them to change their behaviors. Individuals who are ostracized report feeling alone, frustrated, sad, and unworthy and having lower self-esteem (Bastian &amp; Haslam, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_038">Bastian, B., &amp; Haslam, N.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_s01_p01">In some cases, social influence occurs rather passively, without any obvious intent of one person to influence the other, such as when we learn about and adopt the beliefs and behaviors of the people around us, often without really being aware that we are doing so. Social influence occurs when a young child adopts the beliefs and values of his or her parents or when we start liking jazz music, without really being aware of it, because our roommate plays a lot of it. In other cases, social influence is anything but subtle; it involves one or more individuals actively attempting to change the beliefs or behaviors of others, as is evident in the attempts of the members of a jury to get a dissenting member to change his or her opinion, the use of a popular sports figure to encourage children to buy products, or the messages that cult leaders give to their followers to encourage them to engage in the behaviors required of the group.</p>

When asked to describe themselves, individuals in Western cultures generally tend to indicate that they like to “do their own thing,” prefer to live their lives independently, and base their happiness and self-worth upon their own personal achievements. In short, in Western cultures the emphasis is on self-concern.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_s02_p04">Other researchers have studied other cultural differences, such as variations in orientations toward time. Some cultures are more concerned with arriving and departing according to a fixed schedule, whereas others consider time in a more flexible manner (Levine &amp; Norenzayan, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_044">Levine, R. V., &amp; Norenzayan, A. (1999). The pace of life in 31 countries. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 30</em>(2), 178–205.</span> Levine and colleagues (1999)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_045">Levine, R. V., &amp; Norenzayan, A. (1999). The pace of life in 31 countries. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 30</em>(2), 178–205.</span> found that “the pace of life,” as assessed by average walking speed in downtown locations and the speed with which postal clerks completed a simple request, was fastest in Western countries (but also including Japan) and slowest in economically undeveloped countries. It has also been argued that there are differences in the extent to which people in different cultures are bound by social norms and customs, rather than being free to express their own individuality without regard to considering social norms (Gelfand et al., 1996).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn01_046">Gelfand, M. J., Raver, J. L., Nishii, L., Leslie, L. M., Lun, J., Lim, B. C.,…Yamagushi, S. (2011). Differences between tight and loose cultures: A 33-nation study. <em class="emphasis">Science, 332</em>(6033), 1100–1104.</span> And there are also cultural differences regarding personal space, such as how close individuals stand to each other when talking, as well as differences in the communication styles individuals employ.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_s02_p05">It is important to be aware of cultures and cultural differences, at least in part because people with different cultural backgrounds are increasingly coming into contact with each other as a result of increased travel and immigration and the development of the Internet and other forms of communication. In the United States, for instance, there are many different ethnic groups, and the proportion of the population that comes from minority (non-White) groups is increasing from year to year. Minorities will account for a much larger proportion of the total new entries into the U.S. workforce over the next decades. In fact, minorities, which are now roughly one third of the U.S. population, are expected to become the majority by 2042, and the United States is expected to be 54% minority by 2050. By 2023, more than half of all children will be minorities (U.S. Census Bureau, n.d.). These changes will result in considerable growth in cultural diversity in the United States, and although this will create the potential for useful cooperation and productive interaction, it may also produce unwanted social conflict. Being aware of cultural differences and considering their influence on how we behave toward others is an important part of a basic understanding of social psychology and a topic that we will return to frequently in this book.</p>

                            <li>On March 13, 1964, 28-year-old Kitty Genovese was attacked and killed by a male attacker within a few yards of her apartment building in New York City. When 38 of Kitty’s neighbors in the apartment building were later interviewed by the police, they said that they had seen or heard the attack occurring. And yet not one of these 38 people had bothered to intervene, and only one person had called the police, but that was long after Genovese was dead.</li>
                            <li>After Hurricane Katrina hit the southern coast of the United States in 2005, thousands of people came from across the country, and even from around the world, to clean up the mess and repair the damage that the storm had caused on the streets of New Orleans and other Southern towns. Many of these volunteers had been to New Orleans and some had families there. Yet others came simply because they had heard about the disaster and wanted to help the people of New Orleans.</li>
                            <li>In the early part of 2004, U.S. soldiers at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq tortured their Iraqi captives, for instance, by immersing them in water so they would think they were drowning and by sexually humiliating them. Yet the soldiers were in Iraq in part to prevent torture by the ruthless dictator Saddam Hussein.</li>
                            <li>The worst school shooting in U.S. history was the Virginia Tech massacre that occurred on April 16, 2007. The perpetrator, Seung-Hui Cho, killed 32 people and wounded many more before committing suicide.</li>
                            <li>When the global financial services firm Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, it marked the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history. The collapse precipitated a major decline in real estate prices across the country and a global recession. A March 2010 report by a court-appointed examiner indicated that Lehman executives had regularly used accounting gimmicks to make the company’s finances appear better than they really were, creating a misleading picture of the firm’s financial condition.</li>
