    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_p01">Although affect can be harmful if it is unregulated or unchecked, our moods and emotions normally help us function efficiently and in a way that increases our chances of survival (Bless, Bohner, Schwarz, &amp; Strack, 1990; Schwarz et al., 1991).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_008">Bless, H., Bohner, G., Schwarz, N., &amp; Strack, F.

(1991). Ease of retrieval as information: Another look at the availability heuristic. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 61,</em> 195–202.</span> The experience of disgust helps us stay healthy by helping us avoid situations that are likely to carry disease (Oaten, Stevenson, &amp; Case, 2009),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_009">Oaten, M., Stevenson, R. J., &amp; Case, T. I. (2009). Disgust as a disease-avoidance mechanism. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 135,</em> 303–321.</span>, and the experience of embarrassment helps us respond appropriately to situations in which we may have violated social norms.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_p02">Affect signals either that things are going OK (e.g., because we are in a good mood or are experiencing joy or serenity) or that things are not going so well (we are in a bad mood, anxious, upset, or angry). When we are happy, we may seek out and socialize with others; when we are angry, we may attack; and when we are fearful, we are more likely to turn to safety. In short, our emotions help us to determine whether our interactions with others are appropriate, to predict how others are going to respond to us, and to regulate our behavior toward others.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p01">Our emotions are determined in part by responses of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sympathetic nervous system (SNS)</a><span class="glossdef">The division of the autonomic nervous system that is involved in preparing the body to respond to threats by activating the organs and the glands in the endocrine system.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">the division of the autonomic nervous system that is involved in preparing the body to respond to threats by activating the organs and the glands in the endocrine system.</em> The SNS works in opposition to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)</a><span class="glossdef">The division of the autonomic nervous system that is involved in resting, digesting, relaxing, and recovering.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">the division of the autonomic nervous system that is involved in resting, digesting, relaxing, and recovering.</em> When it is activated, the SNS provides us with energy to respond to our environment. The liver puts extra sugar into the bloodstream, the heart pumps more blood, our pupils dilate to help us see better, respiration increases, and we begin to perspire to cool the body. The sympathetic nervous system also acts to release stress hormones including <em class="emphasis">epinephrine</em> and <em class="emphasis">norepinephrine</em>. At the same time, the action of the PNS is decreased.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p02">We experience the activation of the SNS as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">arousal</a><span class="glossdef">The changes in bodily sensations caused by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, including increased blood pressure, heart rate, perspiration, and respiration.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">changes in bodily sensations, including increased blood pressure, heart rate, perspiration, and respiration.</em> Arousal is the feeling that accompanies strong emotions. I’m sure you can remember a time when you were in love, angry, afraid, or very sad and experienced the arousal that accompanied the emotion. Perhaps you remember feeling flushed, feeling your heart pounding, feeling sick to your stomach, or having trouble breathing.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p03">The experience of emotion is also controlled in part by one of the evolutionarily oldest parts of our brain—the part known as the <em class="emphasis">limbic system</em>—which includes several brain structures that help us experience emotion.

Imagine, for instance, your fearful reaction to the sight of a car unexpectedly pulling out in front of you while you are driving, or your happiness in unexpectedly learning that you won an important prize.

New York, NY: Times Books/Henry Holt and Co.</span> studied the expression and interpretation of the basic emotions in a variety of cultures, including those that had had almost no outside contact (such as Papua New Guinea). In his research, he showed people stimuli that would create a given emotion (such as a dead pig on the ground to create disgust) and videotaped the people as they expressed the emotion they would feel in that circumstance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p03">Ekman then asked people in other cultures to identify the emotions from the videotapes. He found that the basic emotions were cross-cultural in the sense that they are expressed and experienced consistently across many different cultures. A recent meta-analysis examined the perception of the basic emotions in 162 samples, with pictures and raters from many countries, including New Guinea, Malaysia, Germany, and Ethiopia. The analysis found that in only 3% of these samples was even a single basic emotion recognized at rates below chance (Elfenbein &amp; Ambady, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_013">Elfenbein, H.

When a close friend of yours wins a prize that you thought you had deserved, you might well feel depressed, angry, resentful, and ashamed. You might mull over the event for weeks or even months, experiencing these negative emotions each time you think about it (Martin &amp; Tesser, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_014">Martin, L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s03_p01">Although there are many similarities across cultures in how we experience emotions, there are also some differences (Marsh, Elfenbein, &amp; Ambady, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_016">Marsh, A.

Nonverbal “accents”: Cultural differences in facial expressions of emotion. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science, 14</em>(4), 373–376.</span> In Japan, there is a tendency to hide emotions in public, which makes them harder for others to perceive (Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_017">Markus, H., &amp; Kitayama, S.

New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Book Company.</span> And as we would expect on the basis of cultural differences between individualism and collectivism, emotions are more focused on other-concern in Eastern cultures, such as Japan and Turkey, but relatively more focused on self-concern in Western cultures (Kitayama, Mesquita, &amp; Karasawa, 2006; Uchida, Kitayama, Mesquita, Reyes, &amp; Morling, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_018">Kitayama, S., Mesquita, B., &amp; Karasawa, M.

Self-enhancing emotions such as pride and anger are more culturally appropriate emotions to express in Western cultures, whereas other-oriented emotions such as friendliness and shame are seen as more culturally appropriate in Eastern cultures. Similarly, Easterners experience more positive emotions when they are with others, whereas Westerners are more likely to experience positive emotions when they are alone and as a result of their personal accomplishments (Kitayama, Karasawa, &amp; Mesquita, 2004; Masuda &amp; Kitayama, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_020">Kitayama, S., Karasawa, M., &amp; Mesquita, B.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Moods Provide Information About Our Social Worlds</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s04_p01">One function of mood is to help us determine how we should evaluate our current situation. Positive moods will likely lead us to maintain our current activities, which seem to be successful, whereas negative moods suggest that we may wish to attempt to change things to improve our situation. And moods have other influences on our cognition and behavior: Positive moods may lead us to think more creatively and to be more flexible in how we respond to opinions that are inconsistent with cultural norms (Ashton-James, Maddux, Galinsky, &amp; Chartrand, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_026">Ashton-James, C. E., Maddux, W. W., Galinsky, A. D., &amp; Chartrand, T. L. (2009).

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s04_p02">Mood states are also powerful determinants of our current well-being. To study how people use mood states as information to help them determine their current well-being, Norbert Schwarz and Gerald Clore (1983)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_028">Schwarz, N., &amp; Clore, G. L. (1983). Mood, misattribution, and judgments of well-being: Informative and directive functions of affective states. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">45,</em> 513–523.</span> called participants on the telephone, pretending that they were researchers from a different city conducting a survey. Furthermore, they varied the day on which they made the calls, such that some of the participants were interviewed on sunny days and some were interviewed on rainy days. During the course of the interview, the participants were asked to report on their current mood states and also on their general well-being. Schwarz and Clore found that the participants reported better moods and greater well-being on sunny days than they did on rainy days.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s04_p03">Schwarz and Clore wondered whether people were using their current mood (“I feel good today”) to determine how they felt about their life overall. To test this idea, they simply asked half of their respondents about the local weather conditions at the beginning of the interview. The idea was to subtly focus these participants on the fact that the weather might be influencing their mood states. And they found that as soon as they did this, although mood states were still influenced by the weather, the weather no longer influenced perceptions of well-being (<a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s04_f01">Figure 3.2 "Mood as Information"</a>). When the participants were aware that their moods might have been influenced by the weather, they realized that the moods were not informative about their overall well-being, and so they no longer used this information. Similar effects have been found for mood that is induced by music or other sources (Keltner, Locke, &amp; Audrain, 1993; Savitsky, Medvec, Charlton, &amp; Gilovich, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_029">Keltner, D., Locke, K.

Even finding a coin in a pay phone or being offered some milk and cookies is enough to put people in good moods and to make them rate their surroundings more positively (Clark &amp; Isen, 1982; Isen &amp; Levin, 1972; Isen, Shalker, Clark, &amp; Karp, 1978).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_032">Clark, M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s05_p01">Although arousal is necessary for emotion, it is not sufficient. Arousal becomes emotion only when it is accompanied by a label or by an explanation for the arousal (Schachter &amp; Singer, 1962).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_035">Schachter, S., &amp; Singer, J. (1962). Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Review, 69</em>(5), 379–399.</span> Thus, although emotions are usually considered to be affective in nature, they really represent an excellent example of the joint influence of affect and cognition. We can say, then, that emotions have <em class="emphasis">two factors</em>—an arousal factor and a cognitive factor (James, 1890; Schachter &amp; Singer, 1962).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_036">James, W.

                    <span class="mathphrase">Emotion = arousal + cognition</span>
                </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s05_p02">In some cases, it may be difficult for people who are experiencing a high level of arousal to accurately determine which emotion they are experiencing. That is, they may be certain that they are feeling arousal, but the meaning of the arousal (the cognitive factor) may be less clear. Some romantic relationships, for instance, are characterized by high levels of arousal, and the partners alternately experience extreme highs and lows in the relationship. One day they are madly in love with each other, and the next they are having a huge fight. In situations that are accompanied by high arousal, people may be unsure what emotion they are experiencing. In the high-arousal relationship, for instance, the partners may be uncertain whether the emotion they are feeling is love, hate, or both at the same time. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Misattribution of arousal</a><span class="glossdef">The incorrect labeling of the source of the arousal that we are experiencing.</span></span> occurs <em class="emphasis">when people incorrectly label the source of the arousal that they are experiencing</em>.</p>

            <p class="simpara">Misattributing Arousal</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p11">If you think a bit about your own experiences of different emotions, and if you consider the equation that suggests that emotions are represented by both arousal and cognition, you might start to wonder how much was determined by each. That is, do we know what emotion we are experiencing by monitoring our feelings (arousal) or by monitoring our thoughts (cognition)?</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p12">Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer (1962)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_038">Schachter, S., &amp; Singer, J. (1962). Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Review, 69</em>(5), 379–399.</span> addressed this question in a well-known social psychological experiment. Schachter and Singer believed that the cognitive part of the emotion was critical—in fact, they believed that the arousal that we are experiencing could be interpreted as any emotion, provided we had the right label for it. Thus they hypothesized that if individuals are experiencing arousal for which they have no immediate explanation, they will “label” this state in terms of the cognitions that are most accessible in the environment. On the other hand, they argued that people who already have a clear label for their arousal would have no need to search for a relevant label and therefore should not experience an emotion.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p13">In the research experiment, the male participants were told that they would be participating in a study on the effects of a new drug, called “suproxin,” on vision. On the basis of this cover story, the men were injected with a shot of epinephrine, a drug that produces physiological arousal. The idea was to give all the participants arousal; epinephrine normally creates feelings of tremors, flushing, and accelerated breathing in people.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p14">Then, according to random assignment to conditions, the men were told that the drug would make them feel certain ways. The men in the <em class="emphasis">epinephrine-informed condition</em> were told the truth about the effects of the drug—they were told that other participants had experienced tremors and that their hands would start to shake, their hearts would start to pound, and their faces might get warm and flushed. The participants in the <em class="emphasis">epinephrine-uninformed condition</em>, however, were told something untrue—that their feet would feel numb, that they would have an itching sensation over parts of their body, and that they might get a slight headache. The idea was to make some of the men think that the arousal they were experiencing was caused by the drug (the informed condition), whereas others would be unsure where the arousal came from (the uninformed condition).</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p15">Then the men were left alone with a confederate who they thought had received the same injection. While they were waiting for the experiment (which was supposedly about vision) to begin, the confederate behaved in a wild and crazy (Schachter and Singer called it “euphoric”) manner. He wadded up spitballs, flew paper airplanes, and played with a hula hoop. He kept trying to get the participants to join in his games. Then right before the vision experiment was to begin, the participants were asked to indicate their current emotional states on a number of scales. One of the emotions they were asked about was euphoria.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p16">If you are following the story here, you will realize what was expected—that the men who had a label for their arousal (the informed group) would not be experiencing much emotion—they had a label already available for their arousal. The men in the misinformed group, on the other hand, were expected to be unsure about the source of the arousal—they needed to find an explanation for their arousal, and the confederate provided one. Indeed, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s05_f03">Figure 3.4 "Misattributing Emotion"</a>, this is just what the researchers found.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p17">Then Schachter and Singer did another part of the study, using new participants. Everything was exactly the same except for the behavior of the confederate. Rather than being euphoric, he acted angry. He complained about having to complete the questionnaire he had been asked to do, indicating that they questions were stupid and too personal. He ended up tearing up the questionnaire that he was working on, yelling, “I don’t have to tell them that!” Then he grabbed his books and stormed out of the room.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s05_p04">What do you think happened in this condition? The answer, of course, is, exactly the same thing—the misinformed participants experienced more anger than did the informed participants. The idea is that because cognitions are such strong determinants of emotional states, the same state of physiological arousal could be labeled in many different ways, depending entirely on the label provided by the social situation.</p>

                <li>A major part of our everyday experiences—particularly those behaviors that have substantial impact on our health and happiness—is the result of affect. Affect helps us engage in behaviors that are appropriate to our perceptions of a social situation.</li>
                <li>Our emotions are determined in part by responses of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the limbic system (particularly the amygdala). The outcome of the activation of the SNS is the experience of arousal.</li>
                <li>The basic emotions of anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise are expressed and experienced consistently across many different cultures.</li>
                <li>There are also a large number of secondary emotions, such as guilt, shame, and embarrassment, that provide us with more complex feelings about our social worlds and that are more cognitively based.</li>
                <li>There are at least some differences in the experience of emotion between men and women and across cultures.</li>
                <li>We use our mood states as information to help us determine our current situation and our well-being. Mood states influence information processing through their effects on processing fluency.</li>
                <li>In some cases, it may be difficult to accurately determine the source of the arousal we are experiencing, and we may misattribute the arousal.</li>
