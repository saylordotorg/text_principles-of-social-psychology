    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_p01">We have now seen that social categorization occurs whenever we think about others in terms of their category memberships rather than on the basis of other, more personal information about the individual. And we have seen that social categorization can have a variety of negative consequences for the people who are the targets of our stereotypes. But social categorization becomes even more important, and has even more powerful effects upon our reactions to others, when the categorization becomes more emotionally involving, and particularly when the categorization involves categorization into liked ingroups and potentially disliked outgroups (Amodio &amp; Devine, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn12_058">Amodio, D.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_p02">Because our ancestors lived in small social groups that were frequently in conflict with other groups, it was evolutionarily functional for them to view members of other groups as different and potentially dangerous (Brewer &amp; Caporael, 2006; Navarrete, Kurzban, Fessler, &amp; Kirkpatrick, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn12_059">Brewer, M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p01">In his important research on group perceptions, Henri Tajfel and his colleagues (Tajfel, Billig, Bundy, &amp; Flament, 1971)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn12_061">Tajfel, H., Billig, M., Bundy, R., &amp; Flament, C. (1971). Social categorization and intergroup behavior. <em class="emphasis">European Journal of Social Psychology, 1</em>, 149–178.</span> demonstrated how incredibly powerful the role of self-concern is in group perceptions. He found that just dividing people into arbitrary groups produces <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ingroup favoritism</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency to respond more positively to our ingroups than we do to outgroups.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">the tendency to respond more positively to people from our ingroups than we do to people from outgroups</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p02">In Tajfel’s research, small groups of high school students came to his laboratory for a study supposedly concerning “artistic tastes.” The students were first shown a series of paintings by two contemporary artists, Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky. Supposedly on the basis of their preferences for each painting, the students were divided into two groups (they were called the X group and the Y group). Each boy was told which group he had been assigned to and that different boys were assigned to different groups. But none of them were told the group memberships of any of the other boys.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p03">The boys were then given a chance to allocate points to other boys in their own group and to boys in the other group (but never to themselves) using a series of payoff matrices, such as those shown in <a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_f01">Figure 12.7 "Examples of Matrices Used in the Minimal Intergroup Studies of Tajfel and His Colleagues"</a>. The charts divided a given number of rewards between two boys, and the boys thought that the rewards would be used to determine how much each boy would be paid for his participation. In some cases, the division was between two boys in the boy’s own group (the ingroup); in other cases, the division was between two boys who had been assigned to the other group (the outgroup); and in still other cases, the division was between a boy in the ingroup and a boy in the outgroup. Tajfel then examined the goals that the boys used when they divided up the points.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p04">A comparison of the boys’ choices in the different matrices showed that they allocated points between two boys in the ingroup or between two boys in the outgroup in an essentially fair way, so that each boy got the same amount. However, fairness was not the predominant approach when dividing points between ingroup and outgroup. In this case, rather than exhibiting fairness, the boys displayed ingroup favoritism, such that they gave more points to other members of their own group in relationship to boys in the other group. For instance, the boys might assign 8 points to the ingroup boy and only 3 points to the outgroup boy, even though the matrix also contained a choice in which they could give the ingroup and the outgroup boys 13 points each. In short, the boys preferred to maximize the gains of the other boys in their own group in comparison with the boys in the outgroup, even if doing so meant giving their own group members fewer points than they could otherwise have received.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p05">Perhaps the most striking part of Tajfel’s results is that ingroup favoritism was found to occur on the basis of such arbitrary and unimportant groupings. In fact, ingroup favoritism occurs even when the assignment to groups is on such trivial things as whether people “overestimate” or “underestimate” the number of dots shown on a display, or on the basis of a completely random coin toss (Billig &amp; Tajfel, 1973; Locksley, Ortiz, &amp; Hepburn, 1980).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn12_063">Billig, M., &amp; Tajfel, H.

Even in a case where there really is no group (at least no meaningful group in any real sense), we still perceive groups and still demonstrate ingroup favoritism.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p01">Ingroup favoritism has a number of causes. For one, it is a natural part of social categorization—we categorize into ingroups and outgroups because it helps us simplify and structure our environment. It is easy, and perhaps even natural, to believe in the simple idea that “we are better than they are.” People who report that they have strong needs for simplifying their environments also show more ingroup favoritism (Stangor &amp; Leary, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn12_071">Stangor, C., &amp; Leary, S.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p02">Ingroup favoritism also occurs at least in part because we belong to the ingroup and not the outgroup (Cadinu &amp; Rothbart, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn12_072">Cadinu, M. R., &amp; Rothbart, M. (1996). Self-anchoring and differentiation processes in the minimal group setting. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70</em>(4), 661–677.</span> We like people who are similar to ourselves, and we perceive other ingroup members as similar to us. This also leads us to favor other members of our ingroup, particularly when we can clearly differentiate them from members of outgroups. We may also prefer ingroups because they are more familiar to us (Zebrowitz, Bronstad, &amp; Lee, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn12_073">Zebrowitz, L. A., Bronstad, P.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p03">But the most important determinant of ingroup favoritism is simple self-enhancement. We want to feel good about ourselves, and seeing our ingroups positively helps us do so (Brewer, 1979).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn12_074">Brewer, M. B. (1979).

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_s03_p01">Although people have a general tendency to show ingroup favoritism, there are least some cases in which it does not occur. One situation in which ingroup favoritism is unlikely is when the members of the ingroup are clearly inferior to other groups on an important dimension. The players on a baseball team that has not won a single game all season are unlikely to be able to feel very good about themselves as a team and are pretty much forced to concede that the outgroups are better, at least as far as playing baseball is concerned. Members of low-status groups show less ingroup favoritism than do members of high-status groups and may even display outgroup favoritism, in which they admit that the other groups are better than they are (Clark &amp; Clark, 1947).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn12_080">Clark, K., &amp; Clark, M.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Personality and Cultural Determinants of Ingroup Favoritism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_s02_p01">To this point, we have considered ingroup favoritism as a natural part of everyday life. Because the tendency to favor the ingroup is a normal byproduct of self-concern, most people do, by and large, prefer their ingroups over outgroups. And yet not everyone is equally ingroup-favoring in all situations. There are a number of individual difference measures that predict prejudice, and these differences become particularly likely to show up under circumstances in which the desire to protect the self becomes important (Guimond, Dambrun, Michinov, &amp; Duarte, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn12_081">Guimond, S., Dambrun, M., Michinov, N., &amp; Duarte, S. (2003). Does social dominance generate prejudice? Integrating individual and contextual determinants of intergroup cognitions. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84</em>(4), 697–721. doi: 10.1037/0022–3514.84.4.697</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_s02_p02">Some people are more likely than others to show ingroup favoritism because they are particularly likely to rely on their group memberships to create a positive social identity. These differences in group identification can be measured through self-report measures such as the Collective Self-Esteem Scale (Luhtanen &amp; Crocker, 1992).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn12_082">Luhtanen, R., &amp; Crocker, J. (1992). A collective self-esteem scale: Self-evaluation of one’s social identity. <em class="emphasis">Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 18</em>, 302–318.</span> The scale assesses the extent to which the individual values his or her memberships in groups in public and private ways, as well as the extent to which he or she gains social identity from those groups. People who score higher on the scale show more ingroup favoritism in comparison with those who score lower on it (Stangor &amp; Thompson, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn12_083">Stangor, C., &amp; Thompson, E.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_s02_p03">Another personality dimension that relates to the desires to protect and enhance the self and the ingroup and thus also relates to greater ingroup favoritism, and in some cases prejudice toward outgroups, is the personality dimension of authoritarianism (Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, &amp; Sanford, 1950; Altemeyer, 1988).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn12_085">Adorno, T.

Authoritarians are ingroup-favoring in part because they have a need to self-enhance and in part because they prefer simplicity and thus find it easy to think simply: “We are all good and they are all less good.” Political conservatives tend to show more ingroup favoritism than do political liberals, perhaps because the former are more concerned with protecting the ingroup from threats posed by others (Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, &amp; Sulloway, 2003; Stangor &amp; Leary, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn12_086">Jost, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_s02_p04">People with strong goals toward other-concern display less ingroup favoritism and less prejudice. People who view it as particularly important to connect with and respect other people—those who are more focused on tolerance and fairness toward others—are less ingroup-favoring and more positive toward the members of groups other than their own. The desire to be fair and to accept others can be assessed by individual difference measures such as desire to control one’s prejudice (Plant &amp; Devine, 1998)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn12_087">Plant, E. A., &amp; Devine, P. G. (1998). Internal and external motivation to respond without prejudice. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 75</em>(3), 811–832.</span> and humanism (Katz &amp; Hass, 1988).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn12_088">Katz, I., &amp; Hass, R.

M., &amp; Malle, B. F. (1995). Social dominance orientation: A personality variable predicting social and political attitudes. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 67</em>, 741–763.</span> People who score high on measures of SDO believe that there are and should be status differences among social groups, and they do not see these as wrong. High SDO individuals agree with statements such as “Some groups of people are simply inferior to other groups,” “In getting what you want, it is sometimes necessary to use force against other groups,” and “It’s OK if some groups have more of a chance in life than others.” Those who are low on SDO, on the other hand, believe that all groups are relatively equal in status and tend to disagree with these statements. People who score higher on SDO also show greater ingroup favoritism.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch12_s02_s02_p06">Stereotyping and prejudice also varies across cultures.

Supporting the hypothesis, they found that Chinese participants made stronger stereotypical trait inferences than Americans did on the basis of a target’s membership in a fictitious group.</p>
