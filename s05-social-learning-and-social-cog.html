        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_n01_p01">On July 12, 1982, a woman in northwest Louisiana was held at gunpoint and raped. During the four hours that the rapist stayed in her house, he identified himself as Marcus Johnson from Leesville, Louisiana.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_n01_p02">When the victim reported the attack, the police could find no information about a Marcus Johnson, but they did find a Rickie Johnson who had once been arrested on a minor traffic charge. Mr. Johnson became the only suspect in the case.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_n01_p03">The victim was shown a photo lineup of three men who were listed as potential perpetrators, although the image of Johnson was eight years old. The victim identified Johnson as the perpetrator, even though he looked very little like the description she had given of the attacker after the rape.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_n01_p04">Johnson was charged with aggravated sexual assault and was tried in Sabine Parish, Louisiana. During the trial the victim told the jury that she was “positive” that he was the perpetrator and there was “no question in [her] mind.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_n01_p05">In 2007, however, Johnson’s innocence was determined with forensic DNA testing, a technology that was not available at the time of the crime.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_n01_p06">Rickie Johnson’s case is only one of many recent DNA exonerations, most of which stem from eyewitness misidentifications. In fact, eyewitness misidentification is the single greatest cause of wrongful convictions. Over the past 10 years, almost 400 people have been released from prison when DNA evidence confirmed that they could not have committed the crime for which they had been convicted. And in more than three-quarters of these cases, the cause of the innocent people being falsely convicted was erroneous eyewitness testimony (Wells, Memon, &amp; Penrod, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_001">Wells, G. L., Memon, A., &amp; Penrod, S. D. (2006). Eyewitness evidence: Improving its probative value. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 7</em>(2), 45–75.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_n01_p07">According to the Innocence Project (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.innocenceproject.org">http://www.innocenceproject.org</a>), “The human mind is not like a tape recorder; we neither record events exactly as we see them, nor recall them like a tape that has been rewound.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_n01_p08">In October 1999, the U.S. Department of Justice released the first national guide for collecting and preserving eyewitness evidence. The guide was commissioned by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wic.org/bio/jreno.htm">http://www.wic.org/bio/jreno.htm</a>) and consisted of a panel of experts, including social psychologist Gary Wells (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/~glwells/bio2001.html">http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/~glwells/bio2001.html</a>), the world’s foremost authority on the psychology of eyewitness identification.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p02">Although being able to correctly identify the perpetrator of a crime that we have observed is fortunately not part of our everyday social activities, we do need to be able to accurately learn about the people that we interact with every day. Our remarkable abilities to size up and remember other people are enhanced by our affective and cognitive capacities. In this chapter, our focus will be on cognition, and we will consider how we learn about, remember information about, and judge others (Fiske &amp; Taylor, 2007; Macrae &amp; Quadflieg, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_002">Fiske, S.

Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons.</span> Then, in <a class="xref" href="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03#stangorsocial_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "Social Affect"</a>, we will turn to a focus on the role of affect in these same processes.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p03">Most generally, this chapter is about <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social cognition</a><span class="glossdef">Mental activity that relates to social activities and helps us meet the goal of understanding and predicting the behavior of ourselves and others.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">the mental activity that relates to social activities and helps us meet the goal of understanding and predicting the behavior of ourselves and others</em>.

We will see that a good part of our learning and our judgments of other people operates out of our awareness—we are profoundly affected by things that we do not know are influencing us. But we also consciously think about and analyze our lives and our relationships with others, seeking out the best ways to fulfill our goals and aspirations.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p04">As we investigate the role of cognition in everyday life, we’ll consider the ways that people use their cognitive abilities to make good decisions and to inform their behavior in a useful and accurate way. We’ll also consider the potential for mistakes and biases in human judgment. We’ll see that although we are generally pretty good at sizing up other people and creating effective social interactions, we are not perfect. And we’ll see that the errors we make frequently occur because of our reliance on our schemas and attitudes and a general tendency to take shortcuts through the use of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cognitive heuristics</a><span class="glossdef">An information-processing rule of thumb that enables us to think in ways that are quick and easy but may sometimes lead to error.</span></span>: <em class="emphasis">information-processing rules of thumb that enable us to think in ways that are quick and easy but that may sometimes lead to error</em>. In short, although our cognitive abilities are “good enough,” there are definitely some things we could do better.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_p01">Human beings have very large brains and highly developed cognitive capacities. Thus it will come as no surprise that we meet the challenges that we face in everyday life largely by thinking about them and then planning what to do about them. Over time, people develop a huge amount of knowledge about the self, other people, social relationships, and social groups. This knowledge guides our responses to the people we interact with every day.</p>
    <div class="section" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Our Knowledge Accumulates as a Result of Learning</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p01">People have many memories about their experiences with other people, and they use this information to make predictions about what people will do in the future. This knowledge is gained through learning. The study of learning is closely associated with the behaviorist school of psychology, which includes the psychologists John B. Watson and B. F. Skinner. For behaviorists, the fundamental aspect of learning is the process of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conditioning</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to connect stimuli (the changes that occur in the environment) with responses (behaviors or other actions).</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">the ability to connect stimuli (the changes that occur in the environment) with responses (behaviors or other actions)</em>. The behaviorists described two types of conditioning that are particularly important in behaviorism: <em class="emphasis">operant conditioning</em> (also known as <em class="emphasis">instrumental conditioning)</em> and <em class="emphasis">classical conditioning</em> (also known as <em class="emphasis">respondent conditioning</em>). When applied to human behavior, these two processes are frequently called, respectively, <em class="emphasis">operant learning</em> and <em class="emphasis">associational learning</em>.</p>
        <div class="section" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Operant Learning</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s01_p01">If a child touches a hot radiator, she quickly learns that the radiator is dangerous and is not likely to touch it again. If we have unpleasant experiences with people from a certain state or country, or a positive relationship with a person who has blonde hair or green eyes, we may develop negative or positive attitudes about people with these particular characteristics and attempt to reduce or increase our interactions with them. These changes in our understanding of our environments represent <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">operant learning</a><span class="glossdef">The principle that experiences that are followed by positive emotions (reinforcements or rewards) are likely to be repeated, whereas experiences that are followed by negative emotions (punishments) are less likely to be repeated.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">the principle that we learn new information as a result of the consequences of our behavior</em>. According to operant learning principles, experiences that are followed by positive emotions (reinforcements or rewards) are likely to be repeated, whereas experiences that are followed by negative emotions (punishments) are less likely to be repeated. In operant learning, the person learns from the consequences of his or her own actions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s01_p02">Although its principles are very simple, operant learning is probably the most important form of human learning. Operant learning occurs when a schoolroom bully threatens his classmates because doing so allows him to get his way, when a child gets good grades because her parents threaten to punish her if she doesn’t, when we begin to like someone who smiles at us frequently, and in hundreds of other cases every day. Operant learning can also be used to explain how people learn complex behaviors, such as how to read, and to understand complex social behaviors, such as the development of social norms and culture.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s01_p03">The application of operant learning to social psychology is straightforward: How do we know which behaviors are most appropriate in a social situation? We learn, in part, because we have positively reinforced for engaging in the appropriate ones and negatively reinforced for engaging in the inappropriate ones. It does not take us long to learn that Margette is more likely to give us the kiss we have been hoping for if we are nice to her or that our children are more likely to share their toys with others if we reward them for doing it. Operant learning has even been used to explain why some people choose to become criminals. According to this approach, criminal behavior is determined by the reinforcements and punishments that the individual experiences (e.g., with peers and with parents) as a result of his or her behavior (Akers, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_003">Akers, R. L. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Social learning and social structure: A general theory of crime and deviance.</em> Boston, MA: Northeastern University Press.</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Associational Learning</h2>

We may enjoy smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee, and eating not only because they give us pleasure themselves but also because they have been associated with pleasant social experiences in the past.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p02">Associational learning also influences our knowledge and judgments about other people. For instance, research has shown that people view men and women who are seen alongside other people who are attractive, or who are said to have attractive girlfriends or boyfriends, more favorably than they do the same people who are seen alongside more average-looking others (Sigall &amp; Landy, 1973).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_004">Sigall, H., &amp; Landy, D. (1973). Radiating beauty: Effects of having a physically attractive partner on person perception. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 28</em>(2), 218–224.</span> This liking is due to associational learning—we have positive feelings toward the people simply because those people are associated with the positive features of the attractive others.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p03">Associational learning has long been, and continues to be, an effective tool in marketing and advertising (Hawkins, Best, &amp; Coney, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_005">Hawkins, D., Best, R., &amp; Coney, K. (1998.) <em class="emphasis">Consumer behavior: Building marketing strategy</em> (7th ed.). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill</span> The general idea is to create an advertisement that has positive features so that it creates enjoyment in the person exposed to it. Because the product being advertised is mentioned in the ad, it becomes associated with the positive feelings that the ad creates. In the end, if everything has gone well, seeing the product online or in a store will then create a positive response in the buyer, leading him or her to be more likely to purchase the product.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p04">A similar strategy is used by corporations that sponsor teams or events. For instance, if people enjoy watching a college basketball team playing basketball, and if that team is sponsored by a product, such as Pepsi, then people may end up experiencing positive feelings when they view a can of Pepsi. Of course, the sponsor wants to sponsor only good teams and good athletes because these create more pleasurable responses.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p05">Advertisers use a variety of techniques to create positive advertisements, including enjoyable music, cute babies, attractive models, and funny spokespeople. In one study, Gorn (1982)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_006">Gorn, G. J. (1982). The effects of music in advertising on choice behavior: A classical conditioning approach. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Marketing, 46</em>(1), 94–101.</span> showed research participants pictures of writing pens of different colors, but paired one of the pens with pleasant music and another with unpleasant music. When given a choice as a free gift, more people chose the pen that had been associated with the pleasant music. In another study, Schemer, Matthes, Wirth, and Textor (2008)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_007">Schemer, C., Matthes, J. R., Wirth, W., &amp; Textor, S. (2008). Does “passing the Courvoisier” always pay off?

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p06">Another type of ad that is based on principles of classical conditioning is one that associates fear with the use of a product or behavior, such as those that show pictures of deadly automobile accidents to encourage seatbelt use or images of lung cancer surgery to discourage smoking. These ads have also been found to be effective (Das, de Wit, &amp; Stroebe, 2003; Perloff, 2003; Witte &amp; Allen, 2000),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_008">Das, E. H. H.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p08">Taken together then, research studies provide ample evidence of the utility of associational learning in advertising, in ads using positive stimuli and in those using negative stimuli. This does not mean, however, that we are always influenced by these ads. The likelihood that associational learning will be successful is greater when we do not know much about the products, where the differences between products are relatively minor, and when we do not think too carefully about the choices (Schemer et al., 2008).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_009">Schemer, C., Matthes, J. R., Wirth, W., &amp; Textor, S. (2008). Does “passing the Courvoisier” always pay off?

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p09">Associational learning is also implicated in the development of unfair and unjustified racial prejudices. We may dislike people from certain racial or ethnic groups because we frequently see them portrayed in the media as associated with violence, drug use, or terrorism. And we may avoid people with certain physical characteristics simply because they remind us of other people we do not like.</p>

Nonconscious biasing effects of single instances on subsequent judgments. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 48</em>, 563–574.</span> conducted research that demonstrated the influence of associational learning and how quickly and easily such learning can happen. In his experiment, high school students first had a brief interaction with a female experimenter who had short hair and wore glasses. The study was set up so that the students had to ask the experimenter a question, and (according to random assignment) the experimenter responded in either a negative way or a neutral way toward the participants. Then the students were told to go into a second room in which two experimenters were present and to approach either one of them. The researchers arranged it so that one of the two experimenters looked a lot like the original experimenter and the other one did not (she had longer hair and did not wear glasses). The students were significantly more likely to avoid the experimenter who looked like the original experimenter when that experimenter had been negative to them than when she had treated them neutrally. As a result of associational learning, the negative behavior of the first experimenter unfairly “rubbed off” onto the second.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p11">Donal Carlston and his colleagues (Mae &amp; Carlston, 2005; Skowronski, Carlston, Mae, &amp; Crawford, 1998)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_011">Mae, L., &amp; Carlston, D.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s03_p03">For some of the children, the female model was shown being rewarded for engaging in the behavior, and for other children, she was punished. In support of the principles of operant learning, Bandura’s study found that the children were more likely to be aggressive when the model had been rewarded for the behavior and were less likely to be so when the model had been punished. But even the children who did not see the model receive any reward nevertheless imitated the behavior to some extent. One of the major contributions of this study is the demonstration that children learned new types of aggressive behaviors simply by observing and imitating others.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s03_p04">Observational learning is involved in much of our learning about our social worlds. Observational learning teaches us that Hank is friendly, that Joanna is selfish, and that Frankie has a crush on Malik. In other cases, our knowledge comes more indirectly, from what we read in books or see on TV, or from what our friends tell us, for instance.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_s03_p05">Observational learning is useful because it allows people to learn without having to actually engage in what might be a risky behavior. As Bandura put it,</p>

For this reason, one does not teach children to swim, adolescents to drive automobiles, and novice medical students to perform surgery by having them discover the appropriate behavior through the consequences of their successes and failures. The more costly and hazardous the possible mistakes, the heavier is the reliance on observational learning from competent learners.

            <h2 class="title editable block">How Schemas Develop: Accommodation and Assimilation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s01_p01">Because they represent our past experience, and because past experience is useful for prediction, our schemas serve as expectations about future events. For instance, if you have watched Italian movies or if you have visited Italy, you might have come to the conclusion that Italians frequently gesture a lot with their hands when they talk—that they are quite expressive. This knowledge will be contained in your group schema about Italians. Therefore, when you meet someone who is Italian, or even when you meet someone who reminds you of an Italian person, you may well expect that they will gesture when they talk.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s01_p02">Having a database of social knowledge to draw on is obviously extremely useful. If we didn’t know or couldn’t remember anything about anyone or about anything that we had encountered in the past, our life would be difficult indeed because we would continually have to start our learning over again. Our schemas allow us to better understand people and help us make sense of information, particularly when the information is unclear or ambiguous. They also allow us to “fill in the blanks” by making guesses about what other people are probably like or probably going to do in cases where things are uncertain. Furthermore, the fact that different people have different past experiences—and thus that their schemas and attitudes are different—helps explain why different people draw different conclusions about the same events.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s01_p03">Once they have developed, schemas influence our subsequent learning, such that the new people and situations we encounter are interpreted and understood in terms of our existing knowledge (Piaget &amp; Inhelder, 1966; Taylor &amp; Crocker, 1981).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_016">Piaget, J., and Inhelder, B.

Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</span> Imagine, for instance, that you have a schema—and thus an expectation—that Italians are very expressive, and you now meet Bianca, who has arrived at your school directly from Rome, Italy. You immediately expect her to be outgoing and expressive. However, as you get to know Bianca, you discover that she is not at all expressive and does not “talk with her hands.” In fact, she is quite shy and reserved. How does existing information influence how we react to the new information that we receive?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s01_p04">One possibility is that the new information simply updates our existing expectations. We might decide, for instance, that there is more variation among Italians in terms of expressiveness than we had previously realized, and we might resolve that Italians can sometimes be very shy and thoughtful. Or perhaps we might note that although Bianca is Italian, she is also a woman. This might lead us change our schema such that we now believe that although Italian men are expressive, Italian women are not. <em class="emphasis">When existing schemas change on the basis of new information,</em> we call the process <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">accommodation</a><span class="glossdef">The process that occurs when existing schemas change on the basis of new information.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s01_p05">In other cases, however, we engage in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">assimilation</a><span class="glossdef">The process that occurs when existing knowledge influences new information in a way that makes the conflicting information fit with existing knowledge, thus reducing the likelihood of change.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a process in which our existing knowledge influences new conflicting information to better fit with our existing knowledge, thus reducing the likelihood of schema change</em>. If we used assimilation, instead of changing our expectations about Italians, we might try to reinterpret Bianca’s unexpected behavior to make it more consistent with our expectations. For instance, we might decide that Bianca’s behavior is actually more expressive than we thought it was at first, or that she is acting in a more shy and reserved manner because she is trying to impress us with her thoughtfulness or because she is not yet comfortable at the new school. Or we might assume that she is expressive at home with her family but not around us. In these cases, the process of assimilation has led us to process the new information about Bianca in a way that allows us to keep our existing expectations about Italians more generally intact.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s02_p01">As we have seen in our earlier discussion, accommodation (i.e., the changing of beliefs on the basis of new information) does occur—it is the process of learning itself. Our beliefs about Italians may well change through our encounters with Bianca. However, there are many factors that lead us to assimilate information to our expectations rather than to accommodate our expectations to fit new information. In fact, we can say that in most cases, once a schema is developed, it will be difficult to change it because the expectation leads us to process new information in ways that serve to strengthen it rather than to weaken it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s02_p02">The tendency toward assimilation is so strong that it has substantial effects on our everyday social cognition.

In this research, high school students were asked to read a set of 25 pairs of cards, in which each pair supposedly contained one real and one fake suicide note. The students’ task was to examine both cards and to decide which of the two notes was written by an actual suicide victim. After the participants read each card and made their decision, the experimenter told them whether their decision was correct or incorrect. However, the feedback was not at all based on the participants’ responses. Rather, the experimenters arranged the feedback so that, on the basis of random assignment, different participants were told either that they were successful at the task (they got 24 out of 25 correct), average at the task (they got 17 out of 25 correct), or poor at the task (they got 10 out of 25 correct), regardless of their actual choices.</p>
                <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p10">At this point, the experimenters stopped the experiment and completely explained to the participants what had happened, including how the feedback they had received was predetermined so that they would learn that they were either successful, average, or poor at the task. They were even shown the schedule that the experimenters had used to give them the feedback. Then the participants were asked, as a check on their reactions to the experiment, to indicate how many answers they thought they would get correct on a subsequent—and real—series of 25 card pairs.</p>
                <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p11">As you can see in the following figure, the results of this experiment showed a clear tendency for expectations to be maintained even in the face of information that should have discredited them. Students who had been told that they were successful at the task indicated that they thought they would get more responses correct in a real test of their ability than those who thought they were average at the task, and students who thought they were average thought they would do better than those told they were poor at the task. In short, once students had been convinced that they were either good or bad at the task, they really believed it. It then became very difficult to remove their beliefs, even by providing information that should have effectively done so.</p>

                <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s02_p03">Why do we tend to hold onto our beliefs rather than change them? One reason that our beliefs often outlive the evidence on which they are supposed to be based is that people come up with reasons to support their beliefs. People who learned that they were good at detecting real suicide notes probably thought of a lot of reasons why this might be the case—“Geez, I predicted that Suzy would break up with Billy” or “I knew that my Mom was going to be sad after I left for college”—whereas the people who learned that they were not good at the task probably thought of the opposite types of reasons—“I had no idea that Jean was going to drop out of high school.” You can see that these tendencies will produce assimilation—the interpretation of our experiences in ways that support our existing beliefs. Indeed, research has found that perhaps the only way to reduce our tendencies to assimilate information into our existing belief is to explicitly force people to think about exactly the opposite belief (Anderson &amp; Sechler, 1986).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_019">Anderson, C.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s02_p04">In some cases, our existing knowledge acts to direct our attention toward information that matches our expectations and prevents us from attempting to attend to or acknowledge conflicting information (Fiske &amp; Neuberg, 1990).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_020">Fiske, S.

New York, NY: Academic.</span> To return to our example of Bianca from Rome, when we first meet her, we may immediately begin to look for signs of expressiveness in her behavior and personality. Because we expect people to confirm our expectations, we frequently respond to new people as if we already know what they are going to be like. Yaacov Trope and Erik Thompson (1997)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_021">Trope, Y., &amp; Thompson, E. (1997). Looking for truth in all the wrong places?

Because we believe that Italians are expressive, we expect to see that behavior in Bianca, we preferentially attend to information that confirms those beliefs, and we tend to ignore any disconfirming information. The outcome is that our expectations resist change (Fazio, Ledbetter, &amp; Towles-Schwen, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_022">Fazio, R. H., Ledbetter, J.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s02_p05">Our reliance on schemas can also make it more difficult for us to “think outside the box.” Peter Wason (1960)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_023">Wason, P. (1960). On the failure to eliminate hypotheses in a conceptual task. <em class="emphasis">The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 12</em>(3), 129–140.</span> asked college students to determine the rule that was used to generate the numbers 2-4-6 by asking them to generate possible sequences and then telling them if those numbers followed the rule. The first guess that students made was usually “consecutive ascending even numbers,” and they then asked questions designed to confirm their hypothesis (“Does 102-104-106 fit?” “What about 434-436-438?”). Upon receiving information that those guesses did fit the rule, the students stated that the rule was “consecutive ascending even numbers.” But the students’ use of the confirmation bias led them to ask only about instances that confirmed their hypothesis and not about those that would disconfirm it. They never bothered to ask whether 1-2-3 or 3-11-200 would fit; if they had, they would have learned that the rule was not “consecutive ascending even numbers” but simply “any three ascending numbers.” Again, you can see that once we have a schema (in this case, a hypothesis), we continually retrieve that schema from memory rather than other relevant ones, leading us to act in ways that tend to confirm our beliefs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_s02_p06">Because expectations influence what we attend to, they also influence what we remember. One frequent outcome is that information that confirms our expectations is more easily processed, is more easily understood, and thus has a bigger impact than does information that disconfirms our expectations. There is substantial research evidence indicating that when processing information about social groups, individuals tend to particularly remember information better that confirms their existing beliefs about those groups (Fyock &amp; Stangor, 1994; Van Knippenberg &amp; Dijksterhuis, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_024">Fyock, J., &amp; Stangor, C.

This of course strengthens and maintains our beliefs and produces even more assimilation.

In their research, they gave participants a picture and some information about a fourth-grade girl named Hannah. To activate a schema about her social class, Hannah was pictured sitting in front of a nice suburban house for one half of the participants and was pictured in front of an impoverished house in an urban area for the other half. Then the participants watched a video that showed Hannah taking an intelligence test. As the test went on, Hannah got some of the questions right and some of them wrong, but the number of correct and incorrect answers was the same in both conditions. Then the participants were asked to remember how many questions Hannah got right and wrong. Demonstrating that stereotypes had influenced memory, the participants who thought that Hannah had come from an upper-class background judged that she had gotten more correct answers than those who thought she was from a lower-class background.</p>

My friendly behavior may be reciprocated by Bianca, and if many other people also engage in the same positive behaviors with her, in the long run she may actually become a friendlier person, thus confirming our initial expectations. Of course, the opposite is also possible—if I believe that short people are boring or that women are overly emotional, my behavior toward short people and women may lead me to maintain those more negative, and probably inaccurate, beliefs as well.</p>

Even if the individual is provided with evidence that suggests that he or she was wrong, that individual will likely assimilate that information to the existing belief. Assimilation is thus one of many factors that help account for the inaccuracy of eyewitness testimony.</p>

                <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p12">If schemas serve in part to help us make sense of the world around us, then we should be particularly likely to use them in situations where there is a lot of information to learn about, or when we have few cognitive resources available to process information. Schemas function like energy-savers, to help us keep track of things when information processing gets complicated.</p>
                <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p13">Stangor and Duan (1991)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_028">Stangor, C., &amp; Duan, C. (1991).

In the research, participants were shown information describing the behaviors of people who supposedly belonged to different social groups, although the groups were actually fictitious and were labeled only as the “red group,” the “blue group,” the “yellow group,” and the “green group.” Each group engaged in behaviors that were primarily either honest, dishonest, intelligent, or unintelligent. Then, after they had read about the groups, the participants were asked to judge the groups and to recall as much information that they had read about them as they could.</p>
                <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p14">Stangor and Duan found that participants remembered more stereotype-supporting information about the groups, when they were required to learn about four different groups than when they only needed to learn about one group or two groups. This result is consistent with the idea that we use our stereotypes more when “the going gets rough”—that is, when we need to rely on them to help us make sense of new information.</p>

Furthermore, he had obtained self-reports from the participants about whether they considered themselves to be primarily “morning people” (those who feel better and are more alert in the morning) or “evening people” (those who are more alert in the evening). As shown in the following figure, Bodenhausen found that participants were more likely to make use of their stereotypes when they were judging the guilt or innocence of the individuals on trial at the time of day when the participants acknowledged that they were normally more fatigued. People who reported being most alert in the morning stereotyped more at night, and vice versa. This experiment thus provides more support for the idea that schemas—in this case, those about social groups—serve, in part, to make our lives easier and that we rely on them when we need to rely on cognitive efficiency—for instance, when we are tired.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_p01">Once we have developed a set of schemas and attitudes, we naturally use that information to help us judge and respond to others. Our expectations help us think about, size up, and make sense of individuals, groups of people, and the relationships among people. If we have learned, for example, that someone is friendly and interested in us, we are likely to approach them; if we have learned that they are threatening or unlikable, we will be more likely to withdraw. And if we believe that a person has committed a crime, we may process new information in a manner that helps convince us that our judgment was correct. In this section, we will consider how we use our stored knowledge to come to accurate (and sometimes inaccurate) conclusions about our social worlds. <a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_t01">Table 2.1 "How Expectations Influence Our Social Cognition"</a> summarizes the concepts that we will discuss, some of the many ways that our existing schemas and attitudes influence how we respond to the information around us.</p>

Most of us can ride a bike and operate a television remote control in an automatic way. Even though it took some work to do these things when we were first learning them, it just doesn’t take much effort anymore. And because we spend a lot of time making judgments about others, many of these judgments (and particularly those about people we don’t know very well and who don’t matter much to us) are made automatically (Willis &amp; Todorov, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_032">Willis, J., &amp; Todorov, A. (2006). First impressions: Making up your mind after a 100-Ms exposure to a face. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science, 17</em>(7), 592–598.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p02">Because automatic thinking occurs outside of our conscious awareness, we frequently have no idea that it is occurring and influencing our judgments or behaviors. You might remember a time when you came back from your classes, opened the door to your dorm room, and 30 seconds later couldn’t remember where you had put your keys! You know that you must have used the keys to get in, and you know you must have put them somewhere, but you simply don’t remember a thing about it. Because many of our everyday judgments and behaviors are performed “on automatic,” we may not always be aware that they are occurring or influencing us.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p03">It is of course a good thing that many things operate automatically because it would be a real pain to have to think about them all the time. If you couldn’t drive a car automatically, you wouldn’t be able to talk to the other people riding with you or listen to the radio at the same time—you’d have to be putting most of your attention into driving. On the other hand, relying on our snap judgments about Bianca—that she’s likely to be expressive, for instance—can be erroneous. Sometimes we need to—and should—go beyond automatic cognition and consider people more carefully. <em class="emphasis">When we deliberately size up and think about something—for instance another person</em>—we call it thoughtful cognition or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">controlled cognition</a><span class="glossdef">Deliberate, effortful thinking about a topic.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p04">Although you might think that controlled cognition would be more common and that automatic thinking would be less likely, that is not always the case. The problem is that thinking takes effort and time, and we often don’t have too much of those things available. As a result, we frequently rely on automatic cognition, and these processes—acting outside of our awareness—have a big effect on our behaviors. In the following Research Focus, we will consider an example of a study that uses a common social cognitive procedure known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">priming</a><span class="glossdef">The technique of temporarily bringing information into memory through exposure to situational events.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">a technique in which information is temporarily brought into memory through exposure to situational events</em>—and that shows that priming can influence judgments entirely out of awareness.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p15">In one demonstration of how automatic cognition can influence our behaviors without us being aware of them, John Bargh and his colleagues (Bargh, Chen, &amp; Burrows, 1996)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_033">Bargh, J. A., Chen, M., &amp; Burrows, L. (1996). Automaticity of social behavior: Direct effects of trait construct and stereotype activation on action. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71</em>(2), 230–244.</span> conducted two studies, each with the exact same procedure. In the experiments, they showed college students sets of five scrambled words. The students were to unscramble the five words in each set to make a sentence. Furthermore, for half of the research participants, the words were related to the stereotype of the elderly. These participants saw words such as “in Florida retired live people” and “bingo man the forgetful plays.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p16">The other half of the research participants also made sentences but did so out of words that had nothing to do with the elderly stereotype. The purpose of this task was to prime (activate) the schema of elderly people in memory for some of the participants but not for others.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p17">The experimenters then assessed whether the priming of elderly stereotypes would have any effect on the students’ behavior—and indeed it did. When each research participant had gathered all his or her belongings, thinking that the experiment was over, the experimenter thanked him or her for participating and gave directions to the closest elevator. Then, without the participant knowing it, the experimenters recorded the amount of time that the participant spent walking from the doorway of the experimental room toward the elevator. As you can see in the following figure, the same results were found in both experiments—the participants who had made sentences using words related to the elderly stereotype took on the behaviors of the elderly—they walked significantly more slowly (in fact, about 12% more slowly across the two studies) as they left the experimental room.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p18">To determine if these priming effects occurred out of the conscious awareness of the participants, Bargh and his colleagues asked a third group of students to complete the priming task and then to indicate whether they thought the words they had used to make the sentences had any relationship to each other or could possibly have influenced their behavior in any way. These students had no awareness of the possibility that the words might have been related to the elderly or could have influenced their behavior.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p05">The point of these experiments, and many others like them, is clear—it is quite possible that our judgments and behaviors are influenced by our social situations, and this influence may be entirely outside of our conscious awareness. To return again to Bianca, it is even possible that we notice her nationality and that our beliefs about Italians influence our responses to her, even though we have no idea that they are doing so and really believe that they have not. It is in this way that our stereotypes may have their insidious effects, and it is exactly these processes that may have led to a mistaken eyewitness account in the case of Rickie Johnson.</p>

Things that are unusual, negative, colorful, bright, and moving are more salient and thus more likely to be attended to than are things that do not have these characteristics (McArthur &amp; Post, 1977; Taylor &amp; Fiske, 1978).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_035">McArthur, L.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p02">We are more likely to initially judge people on the basis of their sex, race, age, and physical attractiveness, rather than on, say, their religious orientation or their political beliefs, in part because these features are so salient when we see them (Brewer, 1988).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_036">Brewer, M. B. (1988). A dual process model of impression formation. In T. K. Srull &amp; R. S. Wyer (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Advances in social cognition</em> (Vol. 1, pp. 1–36). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.</span> Another thing that makes something particularly salient is its infrequency or unusualness. Because Bianca is from Italy and very few other people in our school are, that characteristic is something that we notice—it is salient, and we are therefore likely to attend to it. That she is also a woman is—at least in this context—less salient.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p03">The salience of the stimuli in our social worlds may sometimes lead us to make judgments on the basis of information that is actually less informative than is other less salient information. Imagine, for instance, that you wanted to buy a new music player for yourself. You’ve been trying to decide whether to get the iPod or the Zune. You went online and checked out <em class="emphasis">Consumer Reports</em>, and you found that although the players differed on many dimensions, including price, battery life, ability to share music, and so forth, the Zune was nevertheless rated significantly higher by the owners than was the iPod. As a result, you decide to go purchase one the next day. That night, however, you go to a party, and a friend of yours shows you her iPod. You check it out, and it seems really great. You tell her that you were thinking of buying a Zune, and she tells you that you are crazy. She says she knows someone who had one and had a lot of problems—it didn’t download music right, the battery went out right after it went out of warranty, and so forth—and that she would never buy one. Would you still buy the Zune, or would you switch your plans?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p04">If you think about this question logically, the information that you just got from your friend isn’t really all that important—you now know the opinions of one more person, but that can’t really change the overall consumer ratings of the two machines very much. On the other hand, the information your friend gives you and the chance to use her iPod are highly salient. The information is right there in front of you, in your hand, whereas the statistical information from <em class="emphasis">Consumer Reports</em> is only in the form of a table that you saw on your computer. The outcome in cases such as this is that people frequently ignore the less salient, but more important, information, such as <em class="emphasis">the likelihood that events occur across a large population</em>—these statistics are known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">base rates</a><span class="glossdef">The likelihood that events occur across a large population.</span></span>—in favor of the actually less important, but nevertheless more salient, information.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p05">Another case in which we ignore base-rate information occurs when we use the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">representativeness heuristic</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency to base our judgments on information that seems to represent, or match, what we expect will happen while ignoring more informative base-rate information.</span></span> (remember that <em class="emphasis">heuristic</em> refers to a simplifying strategy that we use to make judgments). The representativeness heuristic occurs when we <em class="emphasis">base our judgments on information that seems to represent, or match, what we expect will happen while ignoring more informative base-rate information</em>. Consider, for instance, the following puzzle. Let’s say that you went to a hospital, and you checked the records of the babies that were born today (<a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_t01">Table 2.2 "Using the Representativeness Heuristic"</a>).

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p06">Most people think that list B is more likely, probably because list B looks more random and thus matches (is “representative of”) our ideas about randomness. But statisticians know that any pattern of four girls and four boys is equally likely and thus that List B is no more likely than List A. The problem is that we have an image of what randomness should be, which doesn’t always match what is rationally the case. Similarly, people who see a coin that comes up heads five times in a row will frequently predict (and perhaps even bet!) that tails will be next—it just seems like it has to be. But mathematically, this erroneous expectation (known as the gambler’s fallacy) is simply not true: The base-rate likelihood of any single coin flip being tails is only 50%, regardless of how many times it has come up heads in the past.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p07">To take one more example, consider the following information:</p>

                <p class="para editable" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s01_p08">I have a friend who is short, shy, and writes poetry. Which of the following is she? (Choose one.)</p>

Why? Because the description (“short, shy, and writes poetry”) just seems so representative or stereotypical of our expectations about Chinese people. But the base rates tell us something completely different, which might make us wary. For one, because I am a psychology professor, it’s much more likely that I know more psychology professors than Chinese professors. And at least on my campus, the number of professors in the psychology department is much bigger than the number of professors of Chinese. Although base rates suggest that “psychology” would be the right answer, the use of the representative heuristic might lead us (probably incorrectly) to guess “Chinese” instead.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Cognitive Accessibility</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s02_p01">Although which characteristics we use to think about objects or people is determined in part by the salience of their characteristics (our perceptions are influenced by our social situation), individual differences in the person who is doing the judging are also important (our perceptions are influenced by person variables). People vary in the schemas that they find important to use when judging others and when thinking about themselves. One way to consider this importance is in terms of the <em class="emphasis">cognitive accessibility</em> of the schema. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cognitive accessibility</a><span class="glossdef">The extent to which knowledge is activated in memory and thus likely to be used in perception.</span></span> refers to <em class="emphasis">the extent to which a schema is activated in memory and thus likely to be used in information processing</em>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s02_p02">You probably know people who are golf nuts (or maybe tennis or some other sport nuts). All they can talk about is golf. For them, we would say that golf is a highly accessible construct. Because they love golf, it is important to their self-concept; they set many of their goals in terms of the sport, and they tend to think about things and people in terms of it (“if he plays golf, he must be a good person!”). Other people have highly accessible schemas about eating healthy food, exercising, environmental issues, or really good coffee, for instance. In short, when a schema is accessible, we are likely to use it to make judgments of ourselves and others.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s02_p03">Although accessibility can be considered a person variable (a given idea is more highly accessible for some people than for others), accessibility can also be influenced by situational factors. When we have recently or frequently thought about a given topic, that topic becomes more accessible and is likely to influence our judgments. This is in fact the explanation for the results of the priming study you read about earlier—people walked slower because the concept of elderly had been primed and thus was currently highly accessible for them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s02_p04">Because we rely so heavily on our schemas and attitudes—and particularly on those that are salient and accessible—we can sometimes be overly influenced by them. Imagine, for instance, that I asked you to close your eyes and determine whether there are more words in the English language that begin with the letter <em class="emphasis">R</em> or that have the letter <em class="emphasis">R</em> as the third letter. You would probably try to solve this problem by thinking of words that have each of the characteristics. It turns out that most people think there are more words that begin with <em class="emphasis">R</em>, even though there are in fact more words that have <em class="emphasis">R</em> as the third letter.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s02_p05">You can see that this error can occur as a result of cognitive accessibility. To answer the question, we naturally try to think of all the words that we know that begin with <em class="emphasis">R</em> and that have <em class="emphasis">R</em> in the third position. The problem is that when we do that, it is much easier to retrieve the former than the latter, because we store words by their first, not by their third, letter. We may also think that our friends are nice people because we see them primarily when they are around us (their friends). And the traffic might seem worse in our own neighborhood than we think it is in other places, in part because nearby traffic jams are more accessible for us than are traffic jams that occur somewhere else. And do you think it is more likely that you will be killed in a plane crash or in a car crash? Many people fear the former, even though the latter is much more likely: Your chances of being involved in an aircraft accident are about 1 in 11 million, whereas your chances of being killed in an automobile accident are 1 in 5,000—over 50,000 people are killed on U.S. highways every year. In this case, the problem is that plane crashes, which are highly salient, are more easily retrieved from our memory than are car crashes, which are less extreme.</p>

When stimuli are highly accessible, they can be quickly attended to and processed, and they therefore have a large influence on our perceptions. This influence is due, in part, to the fact that our body reacts positively to information that we can process quickly, and we use this positive response as a basis of judgment (Reber, Winkielman, &amp; Schwarz, 1998; Winkielman &amp; Cacioppo, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_039">Reber, R., Winkielman, P., &amp; Schwarz, N.

You can see from <a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_s02_f01">Figure 2.4 "Processing Fluency"</a> that the ease of processing influenced judgments. The participants who had an easy time listing examples of their behavior (because they only had to list 6 instances) judged that they did in fact have the characteristics they were asked about (either assertive or unassertive), in comparison with the participants who had a harder time doing the task (because they had to list 12 instances). Other research has found similar effects—people rate that they ride their bicycles more often after they have been asked to recall only a few rather than many instances of doing so (Aarts &amp; Dijksterhuis, 1999),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_041">Aarts, H., &amp; Dijksterhuis, A.

Then they asked the same participants to estimate the percentage of other students in their school who would have answered the questions the same way that they did. The students who agreed with the items thought that others would agree with them too, whereas the students who disagreed thought that others would also disagree.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_p02">Although it is commonly observed, the false consensus bias does not occur on all dimensions. Specifically, the false consensus bias is not usually observed on judgments of positive personal traits that we highly value as important. People (falsely, of course) report that they have better personalities (e.g., a better sense of humor), that they engage in better behaviors (e.g., they are more likely to wear seat belts), and that they have brighter futures than almost everyone else (Chambers, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_049">Chambers, J.

Certainly you would be happy that you won, but wouldn’t you probably also be thinking a lot about what might have happened if you had been just a little bit better—you might have won the gold medal! On the other hand, how might you feel if you won the bronze medal (third place)?

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s04_p04">You might have experienced counterfactual thinking in other situations. I remember once that I was driving across the country and my car was having some engine trouble. I really, really wanted to make it home when I got near the end of my journey because I could tell that I was going to be very disappointed if the car broke down only a few miles before I got home (it would have been really easy to have imagined making it the whole way, making it even more painful if I did not). Counterfactual thinking has even been observed on juries—people who are asked to award monetary damages to others who had been in an accident offered them substantially more in compensation if they were almost not injured than they did if the accident did not seem close to not occurring (Miller, Turnbull, &amp; McFarland, 1988).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_053">Miller, D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s04_p05">Again, the moral of the story is clear—our thinking is frequently influenced by processes that we are not aware of and that may lead us to make judgments that seem reasonable but are objectively inaccurate. In the case of counterfactual thinking, the cognitive accessibility of the potential alternative outcome leads to some very paradoxical effects.</p>

Then the participants used their starting estimate to find an answer that sounded plausible. In both cases, the estimates were too low relative to the true value of the product (which is 40,320)—but the first set of guesses were even lower because they started from a lower anchor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s05_p05">Of course, savvy marketers have long used the anchoring phenomenon to help them. You might not be surprised to hear that people are more likely to buy more products when they are listed as four for $1.00 than when they are listed as $0.25 each (leading people to anchor on the four and perhaps adjust only a bit away) and when a sign says “buy a dozen” rather than “buy one.”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s06_p01">Still another potential judgmental bias, and one that has powerful and often negative effects on our judgments, is the tendency to be overconfident in our own skills, abilities, and judgments. We often have little awareness of our own limitations, leading us to act as if we are more certain about things than we should be, particularly on tasks that are difficult. Adams and Adams (1960)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_055">Adams, P. A., &amp; Adams, J. K. (1960).

Some participants made predictions about a fellow student whom they had just met and interviewed, and others made predictions about their roommates. In both cases, participants reported their confidence in each prediction, and accuracy was determined by the responses of the target persons themselves. The results were clear: Regardless of whether they judged a stranger or a roommate, the students consistently overestimated the accuracy of their own predictions (<a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s06_f01" xrefstyle="select:label">Figure 2.5</a>).</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Importance of Cognitive Biases in Everyday Life</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s07_p01">Perhaps you are thinking that the use of heuristics and the tendency to be influenced by salience and accessibility don’t seem that important—who really cares if we buy an iPod when the Zune is better, or if we think there are more words that begin with the letter <em class="emphasis">R</em> than there actually are? These aren’t big problems in the overall scheme of things. But it turns out that what seem perhaps to be pretty small errors and biases on the surface can have profound consequences for people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s07_p02">For one, if the errors occur for a lot of people, they can really add up. Why would so many people continue to buy lottery tickets or to gamble their money in casinos when the likelihood of them ever winning is so low? One possibility, of course, is the representative heuristic—people ignore the low base rates of winning and focus their attention on the salient likelihood of winning a huge prize. And the belief in astrology, which all scientific evidence suggests is not accurate, is probably driven in part by the salience of the occasions when the predictions do occur—when a horoscope is correct (which it will of course be sometimes), the correct prediction is highly salient and may allow people to maintain the (overall false) belief.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s07_p03">People may also take more care to prepare for unlikely events than for more likely ones because the unlikely ones are more salient or accessible. For instance, people may think that they are more likely to die from a terrorist attack or as the result of a homicide than they are from diabetes, stroke, or tuberculosis. But the odds are much greater of dying from the health problems than from the terrorism or homicide. Because people don’t accurately calibrate their behaviors to match the true potential risks, the individual and societal costs are quite large (Slovic, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_061">Slovic, P. (Ed.). (2000). <em class="emphasis">The perception of risk</em>. London, England: Earthscan Publications.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s07_p04">Salience and accessibility also color how we perceive our social worlds, which may have a big influence on our behavior. For instance, people who watch a lot of violent television shows also tend to view the world as more dangerous in comparison to those who watch less violent TV (Doob &amp; Macdonald, 1979).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_062">Doob, A. N., &amp; Macdonald, G. E. (1979). Television viewing and fear of victimization: Is the relationship causal? <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37</em>(2), 170–179.</span> This follows from the idea that our judgments are based on the accessibility of relevant constructs. We also overestimate our contribution to joint projects (Ross &amp; Sicoly, 1979),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_063">Ross, M., &amp; Sicoly, F. (1979). Egocentric biases in availability and attribution. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37</em>(3), 322–336.</span> perhaps in part because our own contributions are so obvious and salient, whereas the contributions of others are much less so. And the use of cognitive heuristics can even affect our views about global warming. Joireman, Barnes, Truelove, and Duell (2010)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_064">Joireman, J., Barnes Truelove, H., &amp; Duell, B. (2010). Effect of outdoor temperature, heat primes and anchoring on belief in global warming. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Environmental Psychology, 30</em>(4), 358–367.</span> found that people were more likely to believe in the existence of global warming when they were asked about it on hotter rather than colder days and when they had first been primed with words relating to heat. Thus the principles of salience and accessibility, because they are such an important part of our social judgments, can create a series of biases that can make a difference.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s07_p05">Research has found that even people who should know better—and who need to know better—are subject to cognitive biases.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s07_p06">Although biases are common, they are not impossible to control, and psychologists and other scientists are working to help people make better decisions. One possibility is to provide people with better feedback. Weather forecasters, for instance, are quite accurate in their decisions, in part because they are able to learn from the clear feedback that they get about the accuracy of their predictions. Other research has found that accessibility biases can be reduced by leading people to consider multiple alternatives rather than focusing only on the most obvious ones, and particularly by leading people to think about exactly the opposite possible outcomes than the ones they are expecting (Hirt, Kardes, &amp; Markman, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_068">Hirt, E.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p19">As we have seen in the story of Rickie Johnson that opens this chapter, one social situation in which the accuracy of our person-perception skills is vitally important is the area of eyewitness testimony (Charman &amp; Wells, 2007; Toglia, Read, Ross, &amp; Lindsay, 2007; Wells, Memon, &amp; Penrod, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_070">Charman, S.

Eyewitness evidence: Improving its probative value. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 7</em>(2), 45–75.</span> Every year, thousands of individuals such as Rickie Johnson are charged with and often convicted of crimes based largely on eyewitness evidence. In fact, more than 100 people who were convicted prior to the existence of forensic DNA have now been exonerated by DNA tests, and more than 75% of these people were victims of mistaken eyewitness identification (Wells, Memon, &amp; Penrod, 2006; Fisher, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_071">Wells, G.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p20">The judgments of eyewitnesses are often incorrect, and there is only a small correlation between how accurate and how confident an eyewitness is. Witnesses are frequently overconfident, and one who claims to be absolutely certain about his or her identification is not much more likely to be accurate than one who appears much less sure, making it almost impossible to determine whether a particular witness is accurate or not (Wells &amp; Olson, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_072">Wells, G. L., &amp; Olson, E. A. (2003). Eyewitness testimony. <em class="emphasis">Annual Review of Psychology, 54</em>, 277–295.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p21">To accurately remember a person or an event at a later time, we must be able to accurately see and store the information in the first place, keep it in memory over time, and then accurately retrieve it later. But the social situation can influence any of these processes, causing errors and biases.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p22">In terms of initial encoding of the memory, crimes normally occur quickly, often in situations that are accompanied by a lot of stress, distraction, and arousal. Typically, the eyewitness gets only a brief glimpse of the person committing the crime, and this may be under poor lighting conditions and from far away. And the eyewitness may not always focus on the most important aspects of the scene. Weapons are highly salient, and if a weapon is present during the crime, the eyewitness may focus on the weapon, which would draw his or her attention away from the individual committing the crime (Steblay, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_073">Steblay, N. M. (1997). Social influence in eyewitness recall: A meta-analytic review of lineup instruction effects. <em class="emphasis">Law and Human Behavior, 21</em>(3), 283–297.</span> In one relevant study, Loftus, Loftus, and Messo (1987)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_074">Loftus, E. F., Loftus, G. R., &amp; Messo, J. (1987). Some facts about “weapon focus.” <em class="emphasis">Law and Human Behavior, 11</em>(1), 55–62.</span> showed people slides of a customer walking up to a bank teller and pulling out either a pistol or a checkbook. By tracking eye movements, the researchers determined that people were more likely to look at the gun than at the checkbook and that this reduced their ability to accurately identify the criminal in a lineup that was given later.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p23">People may be particularly inaccurate when they are asked to identify members of a race other than their own (Brigham, Bennett, Meissner, &amp; Mitchell, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_075">Brigham, J. C., Bennett, L. B., Meissner, C. A., &amp; Mitchell, T. L. (Eds.). (2007). <em class="emphasis">The influence of race on eyewitness memory</em>. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers.</span> In one field study, for example, Meissner and Brigham (2001)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_076">Meissner, C. A., &amp; Brigham, J. C. (2001). Thirty years of investigating the own-race bias in memory for faces: A meta-analytic review. <em class="emphasis">Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 7</em>(1), 3–35.</span> sent White, Black, and Hispanic students into convenience stores in El Paso, Texas. Each of the students made a purchase, and the researchers came in later to ask the clerks to identify photos of the shoppers. Results showed that the White, Black, and Mexican American clerks demonstrated the own-race bias: They were all more accurate at identifying customers belonging to their own racial or ethnic group than they were at identifying people from other groups. There seems to be some truth to the adage that “They all look alike”—at least if an individual is looking at someone who is not of his or her race.</p>

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p24">Even if information gets encoded properly, memories may become distorted over time. For one thing, people might discuss what they saw with other people, or they might read information relating to it from other bystanders or in the media. Such postevent information can distort the original memories such that the witnesses are no longer sure what the real information is and what was provided later. The problem is that the new, inaccurate information is highly cognitively accessible, whereas the older information is much less so. Even describing a face makes it more difficult to recognize the face later (Dodson, Johnson, &amp; Schooler, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_077">Dodson, C. S., Johnson, M.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p25">In an experiment by Loftus and Palmer (1974),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_078">Loftus, E. F., &amp; Palmer, J. C. (1974). Reconstruction of automobile destruction: An example of the interaction between language and memory. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Verbal Learning &amp; Verbal Behavior, 13</em>(5), 585–589.</span> participants viewed a film of a traffic accident and then, according to random assignment to experimental conditions, answered one of three questions:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s07_l01">

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p26">As you can see in in the following figure, although all the participants saw the same accident, their estimates of the speed of the cars varied by condition.

            </div>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p27">The situation is particularly problematic when the eyewitnesses are children, because research has found that children are more likely to make incorrect identifications than are adults (Pozzulo &amp; Lindsay, 1998)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_080">Pozzulo, J. D., &amp; Lindsay, R. C. L. (1998). Identification accuracy of children versus adults: A meta-analysis. <em class="emphasis">Law and Human Behavior, 22</em>(5), 549–570.</span> and are also subject to the own-race identification bias (Pezdek, Blandon-Gitlin, &amp; Moore, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_081">Pezdek, K., Blandon-Gitlin, I., &amp; Moore, C. (2003). Children’s face recognition memory: More evidence for the cross-race effect. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology, 88</em>(4), 760–763.</span> In many cases, when sex abuse charges have been filed against babysitters, teachers, religious officials, and family members, the children are the only source of evidence. The likelihood that children are not accurately remembering the events that have occurred to them creates substantial problems for the legal system.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p28">Another setting in which eyewitnesses may be inaccurate is when they try to identify suspects from mug shots or lineups. A lineup generally includes the suspect and five to seven other innocent people (the fillers), and the eyewitness must pick out the true perpetrator. The problem is that eyewitnesses typically feel pressured to pick a suspect out of the lineup, which increases the likelihood that they will mistakenly pick someone (rather than no one) as the suspect.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p29">Research has attempted to better understand how people remember and potentially misremember the scenes of and people involved in crimes and to attempt to improve how the legal system makes use of eyewitness testimony. In many states, efforts are being made to better inform judges, juries, and lawyers about how inaccurate eyewitness testimony can be. Guidelines have also been proposed to help ensure that child witnesses are questioned in a nonbiasing way (Poole &amp; Lamb, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_082">Poole, D. A., &amp; Lamb, M. E. (1998). <em class="emphasis">The development of interview protocols</em>. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.</span> Steps can also be taken to ensure that lineups yield more accurate eyewitness identifications. Lineups are more fair when the fillers resemble the suspect, when the interviewer makes it clear that the suspect might or might not be present (Steblay, Dysart, Fulero, &amp; Lindsay, 2001),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_083">Steblay, N., Dysart, J., Fulero, S., &amp; Lindsay, R. C. L. (2001). Eyewitness accuracy rates in sequential and simultaneous lineup presentations: A meta-analytic comparison. <em class="emphasis">Law and Human Behavior, 25</em>(5), 459–473.</span> and when the eyewitness has not been shown the same pictures in a mug-shot book prior to the lineup decision. And several recent studies have found that witnesses who make accurate identifications from a lineup reach their decision faster than do witnesses who make mistaken identifications, suggesting that authorities must take into consideration not only the response but how fast it is given (Dunning &amp; Perretta, 2002).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_084">Dunning, D., &amp; Perretta, S.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p30">In addition to distorting our memories for events that have actually occurred, misinformation may lead us to falsely remember information that never occurred. Loftus and her colleagues asked parents to provide them with descriptions of events that did (e.g., moving to a new house) and did not (e.g., being lost in a shopping mall) happen to their children. Then (without telling the children which events were real or made-up) the researchers asked the children to imagine both types of events. The children were instructed to “think real hard” about whether the events had occurred (Ceci, Huffman, Smith, &amp; Loftus, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_085">Ceci, S.

Repeatedly thinking about a non-event: Source misattributions among preschoolers. <em class="emphasis">Consciousness and Cognition: An International Journal, 3</em>(3–4), 388–407.</span> More than half of the children generated stories regarding at least one of the made-up events, and they remained insistent that the events did in fact occur even when told by the researcher that they could not possibly have occurred (Loftus &amp; Pickrell, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_086">Loftus, E.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p31">The ease with which memories can be created or implanted is particularly problematic when the events to be recalled have important consequences. Therapists often argue that patients may repress memories of traumatic events they experienced as children, such as childhood sexual abuse, and then recover the events years later as the therapist leads them to recall the information—for instance, by using dream interpretation and hypnosis (Brown, Scheflin, &amp; Hammond, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_088">Brown, D., Scheflin, A. W., &amp; Hammond, D. C. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Memory, trauma treatment, and the law</em>. New York, NY: Norton.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_p32">But other researchers argue that painful memories such as sexual abuse are usually very well remembered, that few memories are actually repressed, and that even if they are, it is virtually impossible for patients to accurately retrieve them years later (McNally, Bryant, &amp; Ehlers, 2003; Pope, Poliakoff, Parker, Boynes, &amp; Hudson, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_089">McNally, R. J., Bryant, R. A., &amp; Ehlers, A. (2003). Does early psychological intervention promote recovery from posttraumatic stress? <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 4</em>(2), 45–79; Pope, H. G., Jr., Poliakoff, M.

Findings from a survey of historical literature. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Medicine: A Journal of Research in Psychiatry and the Allied Sciences, 37</em>(2), 225–233.</span> These researchers have argued that the procedures used by the therapists to “retrieve” the memories are more likely to actually implant false memories, leading the patients to erroneously recall events that did not actually occur. Because hundreds of people have been accused, and even imprisoned, on the basis of claims about “recovered memory” of child sexual abuse, the accuracy of these memories has important societal implications. Many psychologists now believe that most of these claims of recovered memories are due to implanted, rather than real, memories (Loftus &amp; Ketcham, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn02_090">Loftus, E. F., &amp; Ketcham, K. (1994). <em class="emphasis">The myth of repressed memory: False memories and allegations of sexual abuse</em> (1st ed.). New York, NY: St. Martin’s Press.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s02_s07_p07">Taken together, then, the problems of eyewitness testimony represent another example of how social cognition—the processes that we use to size up and remember other people—may be influenced, sometimes in a way that creates inaccurate perceptions, by the operation of salience, cognitive accessibility, and other information-processing biases.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">2.3</span> Thinking Like a Social Psychologist About Social Cognition</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s03_p01">Consider your schemas and attitudes toward some of the many people you have met in your life—perhaps those you knew in grade school, the people in your family, or those in your church groups or other organizations. And also think about people you have only heard about rather than having met—maybe those from other countries or cultures. Did operant learning influence your opinions about them? Did you model your behavior after them? Or perhaps you had a single negative encounter with one person and disliked that person or his or her social group for a long time after.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s03_p02">Perhaps you can remember some times when you may have misinterpreted events or judged people incorrectly because your opinions were influenced by the operation of your existing expectations. Did you ever falsely assume that someone had a given characteristic and assimilate information into your existing expectations more than you might have? For instance, did you ever find yourself thinking that the referees in a sports game were favoring the other team rather than your own, or that the media was treating the political candidate that you oppose better than the one you prefer? Could this have occurred because your attitudes or beliefs influenced your interpretation of the information?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s03_p03">And perhaps you can remember times when you were influenced by salience, accessibility, or other information-processing biases. Did you ever feel badly when you got a 94 on your test when a 95 would have given you an A or when you changed an answer on an exam rather than sticking with it? In these cases, you might have fallen victim to counterfactual thinking. Perhaps you erroneously judged someone on the basis of your beliefs about what they “should have been like” rather than on the basis of more accurate statistical information—the misuse of the representativeness heuristic.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s03_p04">Finally, think back once more on the story with which we opened this chapter. Can you see now how important social cognition is, and how important it is to understand the ways in which our thinking operates to produce accurate, and yet sometimes inaccurate, judgments? In many ways, our lives are influenced by our social cognition.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s03_p05">I hope that this chapter has provided you with some new and useful ideas about how you and others form impressions and has reminded you how others are forming (potentially erroneous) impressions of you. Most important, perhaps you have learned to be more modest about your judgments. Please remember to consider the possibility that your decisions, no matter how right and accurate they feel to you, may simply be wrong.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">2.4</span> Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s04_p01">This chapter has focused primarily on one of the three ABCs of social psychology, namely, the ways that we learn about and judge other people—our social cognition. The ability to make accurate judgments about our social situation is critical: If we cannot understand others and predict how they will respond to us, our social interactions will be difficult indeed.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s04_p02">We have seen that social cognition is efficient, frequently operating quickly and even out of our awareness, and generally accurate. However, although we are pretty good at sizing up other people and in creating effective social interactions, we are not perfect. The errors we make frequently occur because of our reliance on our mental knowledge (our schemas and attitudes) as well our tendency to take shortcuts through the use of cognitive heuristics. We use schemas and heuristics as energy savers, because we are often overwhelmed by the amount of information we need to process.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s04_p03">Social knowledge is gained as the result of learning—the relatively permanent change in thoughts, feelings, or behavior that occurs as a result of experience. Some learning is based on the principles of operant learning—experiences that are followed by positive emotions (rewards) are more likely to be repeated, whereas experiences that are followed by negative emotions (punishments) are less likely to be repeated. Associational learning occurs when an object or event comes to be associated with a response, such as a behavior or a positive or negative emotion. We also learn through observational learning by modeling the behavior of others.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s04_p04">Accommodation occurs when our existing schemas or attitudes change on the basis of new information. Assimilation, on the other hand, occurs when our existing knowledge influences new information in a way that makes the conflicting information fit with our existing knowledge. Assimilation is often more powerful than is accommodation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s04_p05">Much of our social cognition is automatic, meaning that it occurs quickly and without taking much effort. In other cases, when we have the time and motivation, we think about things more deliberately and carefully. In this case, we are engaging in more thoughtful, controlled cognition.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s04_p06">We pay particular attention to stimuli that are salient—things that are unique, negative, colorful, bright, and moving. In many cases, we base our judgments on information that seems to represent, or match, what we expect will happen. When we do so, we are using the representativeness heuristic.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s04_p07">Cognitive accessibility refers to the extent to which knowledge is activated in memory and thus likely to be used to guide our reactions to others. The tendency to overuse accessible social constructs can lead to errors in judgment, such as the availability heuristic and the false consensus bias. Counterfactual thinking about what might have happened and the tendency to anchor on an initial construct and not adjust sufficiently from it are also influenced by cognitive accessibility.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch02_s04_p08">You can use your understanding of social cognition to better understand how you think accurately—but also sometimes inaccurately—about yourself and others.</p>
