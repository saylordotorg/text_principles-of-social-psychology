        <h3 class="title">Huge Fall in Global Markets Causes Fear and Panic for Investors</h3>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_n01_p01">September 16, 2008, as a result of the failure of over a dozen large banks in the United States, was the beginning of a stock market crisis around the world. On October 11, 2008, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the world financial system was teetering on “the brink of systemic meltdown.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_n01_p02">The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21 percent in one week, and <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em> referred to the crisis as a “stock market crash–the “Panic of 2008.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_n01_p03">Over the next year, the crash erased $8.3 trillion in shareholder wealth.</p>

        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_n01_p04">Stock traders, bankers, and everyday investors all responded with panic:</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_n01_p05">“We aren’t dealing with a fundamental economic issue any longer,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management. “We are dealing with fear. And that doesn’t respond to economic medicine.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_n01_p06">“I think right now there are just some very powerful negative images that are alive in many people’s minds—images of the Depression, images of people selling apples,” said George Loewenstein, a behavioral economist at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_n01_p07">Some investors, like software engineer Sandeep Bhanote, did their best to keep their emotions in check: “Fear is the most dangerous emotion. It can really do the market a lot of harm when maybe it is not necessary to be afraid,”</p>
        <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_n01_p10">“When investors act purely on emotion, there is greater chance of them sabotaging their financial goals,” said Stuart Ritter, a certified financial planner at T. Rowe Price.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p02">Although a good part of our social behavior is determined by cognitive, thoughtful, and rational processes, another part—and particularly those behaviors that have substantial impact on our health and happiness—is the result of affect. Our everyday experiences arouse in us a wide range of moods and emotions, both positive and negative, and these feelings have profound consequences for our lives.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p03">Emotions are particularly social, and that is why they are of such interest to social psychologists. Although we may get angry at our computer, frustrated by our stock trading decisions, or be in love with our car, most emotions have a social component (DeSteno &amp; Salovey, 1996; Keltner &amp; Haidt, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_001">DeSteno, D.

(1999). Social functions of emotions at four levels of analysis. <em class="emphasis">Cognition &amp; Emotion, 13</em>, 505–521.</span> We experience love, anger, guilt, shame, jealousy, and embarrassment for a reason—because these emotions help us develop and maintain positive relationships with others.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p04">We share our emotions with others through our social behavior, including our facial expressions, touch, voice, and posture, and even in our art, poetry, and music (Hertenstein, 2002; Oatley, 2003; Scherer, Johnstone, &amp; Klasmeyer, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_002">Oatley, K.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p05">The goal of this chapter is to review the wide influence of affect on our social lives.

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_p01">Although affect can be harmful if it is unregulated or unchecked, our moods and emotions normally help us function efficiently and in a way that increases our chances of survival (Bless, Bohner, Schwarz, &amp; Strack, 1990; Schwarz et al., 1991).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_008">Bless, H., Bohner, G., Schwarz, N., &amp; Strack, F.

(1991). Ease of retrieval as information: Another look at the availability heuristic. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 61,</em> 195–202.</span> The experience of disgust helps us stay healthy by helping us avoid situations that are likely to carry disease (Oaten, Stevenson, &amp; Case, 2009),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_009">Oaten, M., Stevenson, R. J., &amp; Case, T. I. (2009). Disgust as a disease-avoidance mechanism. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 135,</em> 303–321.</span>, and the experience of embarrassment helps us respond appropriately to situations in which we may have violated social norms.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_p02">Affect signals either that things are going OK (e.g., because we are in a good mood or are experiencing joy or serenity) or that things are not going so well (we are in a bad mood, anxious, upset, or angry). When we are happy, we may seek out and socialize with others; when we are angry, we may attack; and when we are fearful, we are more likely to turn to safety. In short, our emotions help us to determine whether our interactions with others are appropriate, to predict how others are going to respond to us, and to regulate our behavior toward others.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p01">Our emotions are determined in part by responses of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sympathetic nervous system (SNS)</a><span class="glossdef">The division of the autonomic nervous system that is involved in preparing the body to respond to threats by activating the organs and the glands in the endocrine system.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">the division of the autonomic nervous system that is involved in preparing the body to respond to threats by activating the organs and the glands in the endocrine system.</em> The SNS works in opposition to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)</a><span class="glossdef">The division of the autonomic nervous system that is involved in resting, digesting, relaxing, and recovering.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">the division of the autonomic nervous system that is involved in resting, digesting, relaxing, and recovering.</em> When it is activated, the SNS provides us with energy to respond to our environment. The liver puts extra sugar into the bloodstream, the heart pumps more blood, our pupils dilate to help us see better, respiration increases, and we begin to perspire to cool the body. The sympathetic nervous system also acts to release stress hormones including <em class="emphasis">epinephrine</em> and <em class="emphasis">norepinephrine</em>. At the same time, the action of the PNS is decreased.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p02">We experience the activation of the SNS as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">arousal</a><span class="glossdef">The changes in bodily sensations caused by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, including increased blood pressure, heart rate, perspiration, and respiration.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">changes in bodily sensations, including increased blood pressure, heart rate, perspiration, and respiration.</em> Arousal is the feeling that accompanies strong emotions. I’m sure you can remember a time when you were in love, angry, afraid, or very sad and experienced the arousal that accompanied the emotion. Perhaps you remember feeling flushed, feeling your heart pounding, feeling sick to your stomach, or having trouble breathing.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p03">The experience of emotion is also controlled in part by one of the evolutionarily oldest parts of our brain—the part known as the <em class="emphasis">limbic system</em>—which includes several brain structures that help us experience emotion.

The amygdala has connections to other bodily systems related to emotions, including the facial muscles, which perceive and express emotions, and it also regulates the release of neurotransmitters related to stress and aggression (Best, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_010">Best, B.

A recent meta-analysis examined the perception of the basic emotions in 162 samples, with pictures and raters from many countries, including New Guinea, Malaysia, Germany, and Ethiopia.

Self-enhancing emotions such as pride and anger are more culturally appropriate emotions to express in Western cultures, whereas other-oriented emotions such as friendliness and shame are seen as more culturally appropriate in Eastern cultures. Similarly, Easterners experience more positive emotions when they are with others, whereas Westerners are more likely to experience positive emotions when they are alone and as a result of their personal accomplishments (Kitayama, Karasawa, &amp; Mesquita, 2004; Masuda &amp; Kitayama, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_020">Kitayama, S., Karasawa, M., &amp; Mesquita, B.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s04_p01">One function of mood is to help us determine how we should evaluate our current situation. Positive moods will likely lead us to maintain our current activities, which seem to be successful, whereas negative moods suggest that we may wish to attempt to change things to improve our situation. And moods have other influences on our cognition and behavior: Positive moods may lead us to think more creatively and to be more flexible in how we respond to opinions that are inconsistent with cultural norms (Ashton-James, Maddux, Galinsky, &amp; Chartrand, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_026">Ashton-James, C.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s04_p02">Mood states are also powerful determinants of our current well-being. To study how people use mood states as information to help them determine their current well-being, Norbert Schwarz and Gerald Clore (1983)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_028">Schwarz, N., &amp; Clore, G. L. (1983). Mood, misattribution, and judgments of well-being: Informative and directive functions of affective states. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">45,</em> 513–523.</span> called participants on the telephone, pretending that they were researchers from a different city conducting a survey. Furthermore, they varied the day on which they made the calls, such that some of the participants were interviewed on sunny days and some were interviewed on rainy days. During the course of the interview, the participants were asked to report on their current mood states and also on their general well-being. Schwarz and Clore found that the participants reported better moods and greater well-being on sunny days than they did on rainy days.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s04_p03">Schwarz and Clore wondered whether people were using their current mood (“I feel good today”) to determine how they felt about their life overall. To test this idea, they simply asked half of their respondents about the local weather conditions at the beginning of the interview. The idea was to subtly focus these participants on the fact that the weather might be influencing their mood states. And they found that as soon as they did this, although mood states were still influenced by the weather, the weather no longer influenced perceptions of well-being (<a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s04_f01">Figure 3.2 "Mood as Information"</a>). When the participants were aware that their moods might have been influenced by the weather, they realized that the moods were not informative about their overall well-being, and so they no longer used this information. Similar effects have been found for mood that is induced by music or other sources (Keltner, Locke, &amp; Audrain, 1993; Savitsky, Medvec, Charlton, &amp; Gilovich, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_029">Keltner, D., Locke, K.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s05_p01">Although arousal is necessary for emotion, it is not sufficient. Arousal becomes emotion only when it is accompanied by a label or by an explanation for the arousal (Schachter &amp; Singer, 1962).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_035">Schachter, S., &amp; Singer, J. (1962). Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Review, 69</em>(5), 379–399.</span> Thus, although emotions are usually considered to be affective in nature, they really represent an excellent example of the joint influence of affect and cognition. We can say, then, that emotions have <em class="emphasis">two factors</em>—an arousal factor and a cognitive factor (James, 1890; Schachter &amp; Singer, 1962).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_036">James, W.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s05_p02">In some cases, it may be difficult for people who are experiencing a high level of arousal to accurately determine which emotion they are experiencing. That is, they may be certain that they are feeling arousal, but the meaning of the arousal (the cognitive factor) may be less clear. Some romantic relationships, for instance, are characterized by high levels of arousal, and the partners alternately experience extreme highs and lows in the relationship. One day they are madly in love with each other, and the next they are having a huge fight. In situations that are accompanied by high arousal, people may be unsure what emotion they are experiencing. In the high-arousal relationship, for instance, the partners may be uncertain whether the emotion they are feeling is love, hate, or both at the same time. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Misattribution of arousal</a><span class="glossdef">The incorrect labeling of the source of the arousal that we are experiencing.</span></span> occurs <em class="emphasis">when people incorrectly label the source of the arousal that they are experiencing</em>.</p>

            <p class="simpara">Misattributing Arousal</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p11">If you think a bit about your own experiences of different emotions, and if you consider the equation that suggests that emotions are represented by both arousal and cognition, you might start to wonder how much was determined by each. That is, do we know what emotion we are experiencing by monitoring our feelings (arousal) or by monitoring our thoughts (cognition)?</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p12">Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer (1962)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_038">Schachter, S., &amp; Singer, J. (1962). Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Review, 69</em>(5), 379–399.</span> addressed this question in a well-known social psychological experiment. Schachter and Singer believed that the cognitive part of the emotion was critical—in fact, they believed that the arousal that we are experiencing could be interpreted as any emotion, provided we had the right label for it. Thus they hypothesized that if individuals are experiencing arousal for which they have no immediate explanation, they will “label” this state in terms of the cognitions that are most accessible in the environment. On the other hand, they argued that people who already have a clear label for their arousal would have no need to search for a relevant label and therefore should not experience an emotion.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p13">In the research experiment, the male participants were told that they would be participating in a study on the effects of a new drug, called “suproxin,” on vision. On the basis of this cover story, the men were injected with a shot of epinephrine, a drug that produces physiological arousal. The idea was to give all the participants arousal; epinephrine normally creates feelings of tremors, flushing, and accelerated breathing in people.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p14">Then, according to random assignment to conditions, the men were told that the drug would make them feel certain ways. The men in the <em class="emphasis">epinephrine-informed condition</em> were told the truth about the effects of the drug—they were told that other participants had experienced tremors and that their hands would start to shake, their hearts would start to pound, and their faces might get warm and flushed. The participants in the <em class="emphasis">epinephrine-uninformed condition</em>, however, were told something untrue—that their feet would feel numb, that they would have an itching sensation over parts of their body, and that they might get a slight headache. The idea was to make some of the men think that the arousal they were experiencing was caused by the drug (the informed condition), whereas others would be unsure where the arousal came from (the uninformed condition).</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p15">Then the men were left alone with a confederate who they thought had received the same injection. While they were waiting for the experiment (which was supposedly about vision) to begin, the confederate behaved in a wild and crazy (Schachter and Singer called it “euphoric”) manner. He wadded up spitballs, flew paper airplanes, and played with a hula hoop. He kept trying to get the participants to join in his games. Then right before the vision experiment was to begin, the participants were asked to indicate their current emotional states on a number of scales. One of the emotions they were asked about was euphoria.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p16">If you are following the story here, you will realize what was expected—that the men who had a label for their arousal (the informed group) would not be experiencing much emotion—they had a label already available for their arousal. The men in the misinformed group, on the other hand, were expected to be unsure about the source of the arousal—they needed to find an explanation for their arousal, and the confederate provided one. Indeed, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s05_f03">Figure 3.4 "Misattributing Emotion"</a>, this is just what the researchers found.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p17">Then Schachter and Singer did another part of the study, using new participants. Everything was exactly the same except for the behavior of the confederate. Rather than being euphoric, he acted angry. He complained about having to complete the questionnaire he had been asked to do, indicating that they questions were stupid and too personal. He ended up tearing up the questionnaire that he was working on, yelling, “I don’t have to tell them that!” Then he grabbed his books and stormed out of the room.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s01_s05_p04">What do you think happened in this condition? The answer, of course, is, exactly the same thing—the misinformed participants experienced more anger than did the informed participants. The idea is that because cognitions are such strong determinants of emotional states, the same state of physiological arousal could be labeled in many different ways, depending entirely on the label provided by the social situation.</p>

                <li>A major part of our everyday experiences—particularly those behaviors that have substantial impact on our health and happiness—is the result of affect. Affect helps us engage in behaviors that are appropriate to our perceptions of a social situation.</li>
                <li>Our emotions are determined in part by responses of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the limbic system (particularly the amygdala). The outcome of the activation of the SNS is the experience of arousal.</li>
                <li>The basic emotions of anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise are expressed and experienced consistently across many different cultures.</li>
                <li>There are also a large number of secondary emotions, such as guilt, shame, and embarrassment, that provide us with more complex feelings about our social worlds and that are more cognitively based.</li>
                <li>There are at least some differences in the experience of emotion between men and women and across cultures.</li>
                <li>We use our mood states as information to help us determine our current situation and our well-being. Mood states influence information processing through their effects on processing fluency.</li>
                <li>In some cases, it may be difficult to accurately determine the source of the arousal we are experiencing, and we may misattribute the arousal.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p04">Stress is accompanied by increases in arousal. When we experience stress, our heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure increase, and our body begins to secrete adrenaline and other hormones. Perspiration increases to cool down the body. In addition, sugar is released to provide energy, and the pupils dilate to improve our vision. At the same time, the less immediately essential body activities controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), including digestion, are reduced in order to divert more energy to allow the body to react to the threat.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p05">The experience of stress likely had positive aspects for human beings in an evolutionary sense. When we are attacked, afraid, or concerned about our welfare, the body signals us that we need to react, and the stress response is one of those signals. But problems begin when a threat continues over time. When it is extreme or prolonged, stress can create substantial negative mental and physical effects. In fact, when stress occurs for too long, it can lead to exhaustion and even death.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s03_p01">Not all people experience and respond to stress in the same way, and these differences can be important. The cardiologists Meyer Friedman and R. H. Rosenman (1974)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_060">Friedman, M., &amp; Rosenman, R. H. (1974). <em class="emphasis">Type A behavior and your heart</em>. New York, NY: Knopf.</span> were among the first to study the link between stress and heart disease. In their research, they noticed that even though the partners in married couples often had similar lifestyles, diet, and exercise patterns, the husbands nevertheless generally had more heart disease than did the wives. As they tried to explain the difference, they focused on the personality characteristics of the partners, finding that the husbands were more likely than the wives to respond to stressors with negative emotions and hostility.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s03_p02">Recent research has shown that the strongest predictor of a physiological stress response from daily hassles is the amount of negative emotion that they evoke. People who experience strong negative emotions as a result of everyday hassles and who respond to stress with hostility experience more negative health outcomes than do those who react in a less negative way (McIntyre, Korn, &amp; Matsuo, 2008; Suls &amp; Bunde, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_061">McIntyre, K., Korn, J., &amp; Matsuo, H.

The arousal that men experience when they are stressed leads them to either go on the attack, in an aggressive or revenging way, or else retreat as quickly as they can to safety from the stressor. The fight-or-flight response allows men to control the source of the stress if they think they can do so, or if that is not possible, it allows them to save face by leaving the situation. The fight-or-flight response is triggered in men by the activation of the HPA axis.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s03_p04">Women, on the other hand, are less likely to take a fight-or-flight response to stress. Rather, they are more likely to take a <em class="emphasis">tend-and-befriend response</em> (Taylor et al., 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_063">Taylor, S. E., Klein, L.

This approach is also self-protective because it allows the individual to talk to others about her concerns as well as to exchange resources, such as child care. The tend-and-befriend response is triggered in women by the release of the hormone <em class="emphasis">oxytocin</em>, which promotes affiliation. Overall, the tend-and-befriend response is healthier than the flight-or-flight response because it does not produce the elevated levels of arousal related to the HPA, including the negative results that accompany increased levels of cortisol. This may help explain why women, on average, have less heart disease and live longer than men.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s03_p05">The experience of long-term stress—and its potential negative impact on our physical and mental health—represents one example of the powerful influence of the social situation in our everyday lives. These findings represent social psychological principles in action: Our affect, cognition, and behavior are influenced in profound ways by the events that occur to us, and particularly by the people around us. Furthermore, the observed gender differences in response to stress demonstrate another example of the operation of the basic principles of social psychology: Men usually respond to stress by focusing on self-concern (fight or flight) whereas women are more likely to respond by focusing on other-concern (tend-and-befriend).</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Depression and Anxiety</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p01">Unfortunately, stress is not the only negative health consequence that can be caused by our social interactions. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Depression</a><span class="glossdef">An affective disorder in which people experience sadness, low self-esteem, negative thoughts, pessimism, and apathy.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">an affective disorder in which people experience sadness, low self-esteem, negative thoughts, pessimism, and apathy</em>. Physical symptoms, such as loss of appetite and insomnia, may also accompany depression. Almost 3% of the U.S. population—that is, over 7 million people—experience a major depressive event every year, and the incidence is somewhat greater for women than for men (Kessler, McGonagle, Nelson, &amp; Hughes, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_064">Kessler, R. C., McGonagle, K. A., Nelson, C. B., &amp; Hughes, M. (1994). Sex and depression in the National Comorbidity Survey: II. Cohort effects. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Affective Disorders, 30</em>(1), 15–26.</span> And many, many more people suffer from milder, but also harmful, forms of depression. Minor depression—the everyday negative mood or “blues” that most of us experience—is a part of everyday life for many people. It is no surprise that depression has been termed “the common cold of mental illness.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p02">Still another mental health outcome that relates to social behavior is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">anxiety</a><span class="glossdef">A psychological disorder that may be accompanied by a number of physical symptoms, including diarrhea, upset stomach, sweaty hands, shortness of breath, poor concentration, and general agitation.</span></span>—<em class="emphasis">a psychological disorder that may be accompanied by a number of physical symptoms, including diarrhea, upset stomach, sweaty hands, shortness of breath, poor concentration, and general agitation</em>. As with depression, anxiety may be severe in some cases for some people, but it can also occur in more subtle, minor, and yet nevertheless troubling forms for many people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p03">Anxiety and depression have many causes. These syndromes are partially genetically inherited and are also determined in part by body chemicals including hormones and neurotransmitters. Nevertheless, depression and anxiety are also largely socially determined, and social psychologists naturally focus on these aspects. To a social psychologist, depression and anxiety are maladies that are caused by our everyday social lives and that can be understood and treated—at least in part—in a social sense.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p04">Depression and anxiety are caused at least partly by the lack of adequate social interactions. Almost half of Americans describe themselves as being shy. Shy people frequently find it difficult to make friends because they evaluate themselves negatively and feel that they cannot succeed in social encounters (Cheek &amp; Melchior, 1990).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_065">Cheek, J. M., &amp; Melchior, L. A. (1990). Shyness, self-esteem, and self-consciousness. In <em class="emphasis">Handbook of social and evaluation anxiety</em> (pp. 47–82). New York, NY: Plenum Press.</span> Extremely shy people may become lonely, and loneliness is a risk factor for a large range of physical and mental health problems, including depression and anxiety (Cacioppo, Hawley, &amp; Berston, 2003; Christensen &amp; Kashy, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_066">Cacioppo, J.

(1998). Perceptions of and by lonely people in initial social interaction. <em class="emphasis">Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 24</em>(3), 322–329.</span> Depressed people frequently tend to avoid social interactions altogether, whereas shy, anxious people tend to become uncomfortable in public and may overestimate how much people are focusing on them. On the other hand, people who are more extroverted (i.e., who enjoy making friends and being in social situations) are less depressed and have fewer health problems (Diener, Suh, Lucas, &amp; Smith, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_067">Diener, E., Suh, E.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p05">Depression and anxiety are determined both by how we feel about our own performance and by our social interactions with others. We are more likely to feel good about ourselves when we perceive that we have adequate social interactions and that we are accepted and cared for by others—but we are more likely to feel poorly about ourselves when we perceive that we are not measuring up to the goals and standards that others find important. When we feel that there are discrepancies between our goals and the actual conditions in our lives, we feel more emotion (Carver &amp; Scheier, 1981).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_068">Carver, C.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p06">Tory Higgins and his colleagues (Higgins, Bond, Klein, &amp; Strauman, 1986; Strauman &amp; Higgins, 1988)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_069">Higgins, E. T., Bond, R. N., Klein, R., &amp; Strauman, T. (1986). Self-discrepancies and emotional vulnerability: How magnitude, accessibility, and type of discrepancy influence affect. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51</em>(1), 5–15; Strauman, T. J., &amp; Higgins, E. T. (1988). Self-discrepancies as predictors of vulnerability to distinct syndromes of chronic emotional distress. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality, 56</em>(4), 685–707.</span> have proposed that the types of emotional distress we experience are determined by both our perceptions of how well our own behaviors meet the standards and goals we have provided ourselves (our internal standards) and our perceptions of how others think about us (our external standards). Higgins found in his research that people were more likely to experience sadness, dissatisfaction, and other depression-related emotions when they indicated that their current perception of themselves (the actual self-concept) was discrepant with their hopes and goals (the ideal self-concept). But people were more likely to experience fear, worry, tension, and other anxiety-related emotions when they felt that the actual self-concept was discrepant with their beliefs about important standards regarding duty and obligations (the ought self-concept).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p07">Higgins also found in his research that the same negative emotions resulted when there were discrepancies between the actual self-concept and the ideal self-concept or the ought self-concept provided by other important people, such as parents and friends. That is, the participants felt bad about themselves when they did not meet the goals that other people thought were important (the external standards), just as they felt bad about not meeting their own goals (the internal standards). You might not care that much yourself about achieving in school or meeting your family obligations, but your failure to meet these goals may still produce negative emotions because you realize that your parents do think it is important. Again, the importance of the social situation in creating emotional experience is clear.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p08">As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_f01">Figure 3.7 "The Self-Fulfilling Nature of Anxiety and Depression"</a>, still another social aspect of anxiety and depression is that they are contagious and self-fulfilling. When we are depressed or anxious, these feelings show up in our behavior. Other people then see our negative states, and they are likely to respond to us negatively. These responses make it more difficult for us to do well in school and at work and lead to negative outcomes. For instance, people who are depressed or anxious are more likely to be divorced and fired from their jobs and are less fun to be around (Coyne &amp; Downey, 1991).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_070">Coyne, J. C., &amp; Downey, G. (1991). Social factors and psychopathology: Stress, social support, and coping processes. <em class="emphasis">Annual Review of Psychology, 42</em>, 401–425.</span> And these negative outcomes naturally create even more negative cognitions and more negative affect, which in turn make us feel even worse about ourselves.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p09">Given the social determinants of depression and anxiety, it will probably not surprise you to hear that one of the more important approaches to reducing anxiety and depression is to attempt to change our social cognitions and to help us improve our social interactions with others. Many current psychological therapies used to help alleviate depression and anxiety are designed to change the thought processes and the social interactions of individuals with psychological difficulties (Ellis, 2004; Beck, Freeman, &amp; Davis, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_071">Ellis, A.

    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_l01">
            <li>Review the behaviors that are effective and those that are not in helping us cope with negative emotions.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_p01">No matter how healthy and happy we are in our everyday lives, there are going to be times when we experience stress, depression, and anxiety. Some of these experiences will be major and some will be minor, and some of us will experience these emotions more than others. Sometimes these feelings will be the result of clear difficulties that pose direct threats to us: We or those we care about may be ill or injured; we may lose our job or have academic difficulties. At other times, these feelings may seem to develop for no apparent reason.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_p02">Although it is not possible to prevent the experience of negative emotions entirely (in fact, given their importance in helping us understand and respond to threats, we would not really want to if we could), we can nevertheless learn to respond to and cope with them in the most productive possible ways. We do not need to throw up our hands in despair when things go wrong—rather, we can bring our personal and social resources to bear to help us. We have at our disposal many techniques that we can use to help us deal with negative emotions.</p>
    <div class="section" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">What Doesn’t Work: Distorting and Suppressing Negative Outcomes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p01">Perhaps the most common approach to dealing with negative affect is to attempt to suppress, avoid, or deny it. You probably know people who seem to you to be stressed, depressed, or anxious but who cannot or will not see it in themselves. Perhaps you tried to talk to them about it, to get them to open up to you, but were rebuffed. They seem to act as if there is no problem at all, simply moving on with life without admitting or even trying to deal with the negative feelings. Or perhaps you have taken a similar approach yourself: Have you ever had an important test to study for or an important job interview coming up, and rather than planning and preparing for it, you simply tried put it out of your mind entirely?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p02">Research has found that there are clear difficulties with an approach to negative events and feelings that involves simply trying to ignore them. For one, ignoring our problems does not make them go away. Not being able to get our work done because we are depressed, being too anxious to develop good relationships with others, or experiencing so much stress that we get sick will be detrimental to our life even if we cannot admit that it is occurring.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p03">Suppressing our emotions is also not a very good option, at least in the long run, because it tends to fail (Gross &amp; Levenson, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_072">Gross, J. J., &amp; Levenson, R. W. (1997). Hiding feelings: The acute effects of inhibiting negative and positive emotion. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 106</em>(1), 95–103.</span> If we know that we have a big exam coming up, we have to focus on the exam itself in order to suppress it. We can’t really suppress or deny our thoughts because we actually have to recall and face the event in order to make the attempt to not think about it. Furthermore, we may continually worry that our attempts to suppress will fail. Suppressing our emotions might work out for a short while, but when we run out of energy, the negative emotions may shoot back up into consciousness, causing us to reexperience the negative feelings that we had been trying to avoid.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p04">Daniel Wegner and his colleagues (Wegner, Schneider, Carter, &amp; White, 1987)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_073">Wegner, D. M., Schneider, D. J., Carter, S. R., &amp; White, T. L. (1987). Paradoxical effects of thought suppression. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53</em>(1), 5–13.</span> directly tested whether people would be able to effectively suppress a simple thought. They asked participants in a study to not think about a white bear for 5 minutes but to ring a bell in case they did. (Try it yourself—can you do it?) The participants were unable to suppress the thought as instructed—the white bear kept popping into mind, even when they were instructed to avoid thinking about it. You might have had a similar experience when you were dieting or staying home to study—the chocolate bar in the kitchen cabinet or the fun time you were missing by staying home kept popping into mind, disrupting your work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p05">Another poor approach to attempting to escape from our problems is to engage in behaviors designed to distract us from them. Sometimes this approach will be successful in the short term—we might try distracting ourselves from our troubles by going for a run, watching TV, or reading a book, and perhaps this might be useful. But sometimes people go to extremes to avoid self-awareness when it might be better that they face their troubles directly. If we experience discrepancies between our ideal selves and our important self-concepts, if we feel that we cannot ever live up to our or others’ expectations for us, or if we are just really depressed or anxious, we may attempt to escape ourselves entirely. Roy Baumeister (1991)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_074">Baumeister, R. F. (1991). The self against itself: Escape or defeat? In <em class="emphasis">Relational self: Theoretical convergences in psychoanalysis and social psychology</em> (pp. 238–256). New York, NY: Guilford Press.</span> has speculated that maladaptive behaviors such as drug abuse, sexual masochism, spiritual ecstasy, binge eating, and even suicide are all mechanisms by which people may attempt to escape the self.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p06">Not only does research show that attempting to suppress our negative thoughts does not work, there is even evidence that the opposite is true—that when we are faced with troubles, it is healthy to let the negative thoughts and feelings out by expressing them, either to ourselves or to others. James Pennebaker and his colleagues (Pennebaker, Colder, &amp; Sharp, 1990; Watson &amp; Pennebaker, 1989)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_075">Pennebaker, J.

(1989). Health complaints, stress, and distress: Exploring the central role of negative affectivity. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Review, 96</em>(2), 234–254.</span> have conducted many correlational and experimental studies that demonstrate the advantages to our mental and physical health of opening up versus bottling our feelings. This research team has found that simply talking about or writing about our emotions or our reactions to negative events provides substantial health benefits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p07">Pennebaker and Beall (1986)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_076">Pennebaker, J. W., &amp; Beall, S. K.

Confronting a traumatic event: Toward an understanding of inhibition and disease. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 95</em>(3), 274–281.</span> randomly assigned students to write about either the most traumatic and stressful event of their lives or to write about a trivial topic. Although the students who wrote about the traumas had higher blood pressure and more negative moods immediately after they wrote their essays, they were also less likely to visit the student health center for illnesses during the following 6 months in comparison to those who wrote about more minor issues. Something positive evidently occurred as a result of confronting their negative experiences. Other research studied individuals whose spouses had died in the previous year, finding that the more they talked about the death with others, the less likely they were to become ill during the subsequent year. Daily writing about one’s emotional states has also been found to increase immune system functioning (Petrie, Fontanilla, Thomas, Booth, &amp; Pennebaker, 2004),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_077">Petrie, K.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p08">Opening up probably helps in various ways. For one, expressing our problems allows us to gain information from others and may also bring support from them. And writing or thinking about one’s experiences also seems to help people make sense of the events and may give them a feeling of control over their lives (Pennebaker &amp; Stone, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_079">Pennebaker, J.

        <h2 class="title editable block">A Better Approach: Self-Regulation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p01">As we have seen, emotions are useful in warning us about potential danger and in helping us to make judgments quickly, so it is a good thing that we have them. However, we also need to learn how to control our emotions, to prevent our emotions from letting our behavior get out of control. <em class="emphasis">The process of setting goals and using our cognitive and affective capacities to reach those goals</em> is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">self-regulation</a><span class="glossdef">The process of setting goals and using our cognitive and affective capacities to reach those goals.</span></span>, and a good part of self-regulation involves regulating our emotions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p02">To be the best people that we possibly can, we have to work hard at it. Succeeding at school, at work, and at our relationships with others takes a lot of effort. When we are successful at self-regulation, we are able to move toward or meet the goals that we set for ourselves. When we fail at self-regulation, we are not able to meet those goals. People who are better able to regulate their behaviors and emotions are more successful in their personal and social encounters (Eisenberg &amp; Fabes, 1992),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_080">Eisenberg, N., &amp; Fabes, R. A. (1992). Emotion, regulation, and the development of social competence. In <em class="emphasis">Emotion and social behavior</em> (pp. 119–150). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.</span> and thus self-regulation is a skill we should seek to master.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p03">Being able to exert self-control has some important positive outcomes. Consider, for instance, research by Walter Mischel and his colleagues (Mischel, Shoda, &amp; Rodriguez, 1989).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_081">Mischel, W., Shoda, Y., &amp; Rodriguez, M. L. (1989). Delay of gratification in children. <em class="emphasis">Science</em>, <em class="emphasis">244,</em> 933–938.</span> In their studies, they had 4- and 5-year-old children sit at a table in front of a yummy snack, such as a chocolate chip cookie or a marshmallow. The children were told that they could eat the snack right away if they wanted to. However, they were also told that if they could wait for just a couple of minutes, they’d be able to have two snacks—both the one in front of them and another just like it. However, if they ate the one that was in front of them before the time was up, they would not get a second.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p04">Mischel found that some children were able to self-regulate—they were able to override the impulse to seek immediate gratification in order to obtain a greater reward at a later time. Other children, of course, were not—they just ate the first snack right away. Furthermore, the inability to delay gratification seemed to occur in a spontaneous and emotional manner, without much thought. The children who could not resist simply grabbed the cookie because it looked so yummy, without being able to cognitively stop themselves (Metcalfe &amp; Mischel, 1999; Strack &amp; Deutsch, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_082">Metcalfe, J., &amp; Mischel, W.

The role of impulse in social behavior. In A. W. Kruglanski &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Social psychology: Handbook of basic principles</em> (Vol. 2). New York, NY: Guilford.</span> It turns out that these emotional responses are determined in part by particular brain patterns that are influenced by body chemicals. For instance, preferences for small immediate rewards over large later rewards have been linked to low levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in animals (Bizot, Le Bihan, Peuch, Hamon, &amp; Thiebot, 1999; Wilkinson &amp; Robbins, 2004),<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_083">Bizot, J.-C., Le Bihan, C., Peuch, A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p05">The ability to self-regulate in childhood has important consequences later in life. When Mischel followed up on the children in his original study, he found that those who had been able to self-regulate as children grew up to have some highly positive characteristics—they got better SAT scores, were rated by their friends as more socially adept, and were found to cope with frustration and stress better than those children who could not resist the tempting first cookie at a young age. Effective self-regulation is therefore an important key to success in life (Ayduk et al., 2000; Eigsti et al., 2006; Mischel, Ayduk, &amp; Mendoza-Denton, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_085">Ayduk, O., Mendoza-Denton, R., Mischel, W., Downey, G., Peake, P.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p18">Self-regulation is particularly difficult when we are tired, depressed, or anxious, and it is under these conditions that we more easily lose our self-control and fail to live up to our goals (Muraven &amp; Baumeister, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_086">Muraven, M., &amp; Baumeister, R.

Self-regulation and depletion of limited resources: Does self-control resemble a muscle? <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 126</em>, 247–259.</span> If you are tired and worried about an upcoming exam, you may find yourself getting angry and taking it out on your roommate, even though she really hasn’t done anything to deserve it and you don’t really want to be angry at her. It is no secret that we are more likely to fail at our diets when we are under a lot of stress or at night when we are tired.</p>

Self-control as a limited resource: Regulatory depletion patterns. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74</em>(3), 774–789.</span> conducted a study to demonstrate that emotion regulation—that is, either increasing or decreasing our emotional responses—takes work. They speculated that self-control was like a muscle—it just gets tired when it is used too much. In their experiment, they asked their participants to watch a short movie about environmental disasters involving radioactive waste and their negative effects on wildlife. The scenes included sick and dying animals, which were very upsetting. According to random assignment to conditions, one group (the increase-emotional-response condition) was told to really get into the movie and to express emotions in response to it, a second group was to hold back and decrease emotional responses (the decrease-emotional-response condition), and a third (control) group received no instructions on emotion regulation.</p>
            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p20">Both before and after the movie, the experimenter asked the participants to engage in a measure of physical strength by squeezing as hard as they could on a hand-grip exerciser, a device used for building up hand muscles. The experimenter put a piece of paper in the grip and timed how long the participants could hold the grip together before the paper fell out. The following table shows the results of this study. It seems that emotion regulation does indeed take effort because the participants who had been asked to control their emotions showed significantly less ability to squeeze the hand grip after the movie than before. Thus the effort to regulate emotional responses seems to have consumed resources, leaving the participants less capacity to make use of in performing the hand-grip task.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p01">Although stress is an emotional response that can kill us, other emotions can help us cope with and protect ourselves from stress. The stress of the Monday through Friday grind can be offset by the fun that we can have on the weekend, and the concerns that we have about our upcoming chemistry exam can be offset by a positive attitude toward school, life, and other people. Put simply, the best antidote for stress is a happy one: Think positively, have fun, and enjoy the company of others.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p02">You have probably heard about “the power of positive thinking”—the idea that thinking positively helps people meet their goals and keeps them healthy, happy, and able to effectively cope with the negative events that they experience. It turns out that positive thinking really works. People who think positively about their future, who believe that they can control their outcomes, and who are willing to open up and share with others are healthier people (Seligman &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_092">Seligman, M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p03">The power of positive thinking comes in different forms, but they are all helpful. Some researchers have focused on <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">optimism</a><span class="glossdef">A general tendency to expect positive outcomes.</span></span>, <em class="emphasis">a general tendency to expect positive outcomes</em>, and have found that optimists are happier and have less stress (Carver &amp; Scheier, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_093">Carver, C.

People with high self-efficacy respond to environmental and other threats in an active, constructive way—by getting information, talking to friends, and attempting to face and reduce the difficulties they are experiencing. These people, too, are better able to ward off their stresses in comparison with people with less self-efficacy (Thompson, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_094">Thompson, S. C.

New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</span> Self-efficacy helps in part because it leads us to perceive that we can control the potential stressors that may affect us. Workers who have control over their work environment (e.g., by being able to move furniture and control distractions) experience less stress, as do patients in nursing homes who are able to choose their everyday activities (Rodin, 1986).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_095">Rodin, J.

Hardiness and health: A prospective study. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 42</em>(1), 168–177.</span> have argued that the tendency to be less affected by life’s stressors can be characterized as an individual-difference measure that has a relationship to both optimism and self-efficacy—a measure known as <em class="emphasis">hardiness</em>. Hardy individuals are those who are more positive overall about potentially stressful life events, who take more direct action to understand the causes of negative events, and who attempt to learn from them what may be of value for the future. Hardy individuals use effective coping strategies, and they take better care of themselves.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p05">Taken together, these various coping skills, including optimism, self-efficacy, perceived control, and hardiness, have been shown to have a wide variety of positive effects on our health.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p06">It is possible to learn to think more positively, and doing so can be beneficial. Antoni et al.

            <p class="para" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_p24">We have seen that, on average, Westerners tend to view people as independent and separate from others, whereas Easterners tend to view people as fundamentally connected with others. This difference might lead to the prediction that using others for direct social support would be especially common among Easterners, who focus primarily on other-concern. But asking for social support from others to solve one’s problems may be a particularly Western approach. In Eastern cultures, asking others for help in solving one’s personal problems may be seen as too self-concerned and as making inappropriate demands on the others (Kim, Sherman, &amp; Taylor, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_117">Kim, H.

As you can see in the following table, the American students were significantly more likely to rely on exercise to reduce stress and were also significantly more likely to report using social support.

In individualist cultures, relationships are used in part to promote our individual goals, and it is appropriate to ask for help from those in one’s social networks in order to help one do better. In collectivist cultures, individual goals are more likely to be seen as a means for promoting relationships, and pursuing the goals of self-concern may risk straining relationships if one calls on his or her social support network for aid (Markus, Mullally, &amp; Kitayama, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_119">Markus, H.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p01">One difficulty that people face when trying to improve their well-being is that they may not always know what will make them happy. As one example, many of us think that if we just had more money, we would be happier. While it is true that we do need money to afford food and adequate shelter for ourselves and our families, after this minimum level of wealth is reached, more money does not generally buy more happiness (Easterlin, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_120">Easterlin, R. (2005). Feeding the illusion of growth and happiness: A reply to Hagerty and Veenhoven. <em class="emphasis">Social Indicators Research, 74</em>(3), 429–443. doi:10.1007/ s11205-004-6170-z</span> For instance, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_f01">Figure 3.8 "Income and Happiness"</a>, even though income and material success improved dramatically in many countries in past decades, happiness did not. Despite tremendous economic growth in France, Japan, and the United States between 1946 and 1990, there was no increase in reports of well-being by the citizens of these countries. Americans today have several times the buying power they had in the 1950s, and yet overall happiness has not increased.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p02">The problem seems to be that we never seem to have enough money to make us “really” happy.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p03">These findings might lead us to conclude that we don’t always know what does or might make us happy, and this seems to be at least partially true. For instance, Jean Twenge and her colleagues (Twenge, Campbell, &amp; Foster, 2003)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_122">Twenge, J. M., Campbell, W. K., &amp; Foster, C. A. (2003). Parenthood and marital satisfaction: A meta-analytic review. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Marriage and Family, 65</em>(3), 574–583.</span> reviewed studies relating to the impact of having children on well-being and found that although people with children frequently claim that having children makes them happy, couples who do not have children actually report being happier than those who do.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p04">Psychologists have found that people’s ability to predict their future emotional states is not very accurate (Wilson &amp; Gilbert, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_123">Wilson, T. D., &amp; Gilbert, D. T. (2005). Affective forecasting: Knowing what to want. <em class="emphasis">Current Directions in Psychological Science, 14</em>(3), 131–134.</span> For one, people overestimate their emotional reactions to events. Although people think that positive and negative events that they might experience will make a huge difference in their lives, and although these changes do make at least some difference in well-being, they tend to be less influential than we think they are going to be. Positive events tend to make us feel good, but their effects wear off pretty quickly, and the same is true for negative events. For instance, Brickman, Coates, and Janoff-Bulman (1978)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_124">Brickman, P., Coates, D., &amp; Janoff-Bulman, R. (1978). Lottery winners and accident victims: Is happiness relative? <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 36</em>(8), 917–927.</span> interviewed people who had won more than $50,000 in a lottery and found that they were not happier than they had been in the past and were also not happier than a control group of similar people who had not won the lottery. On the other hand, the researchers found that individuals who were paralyzed as a result of accidents were not as unhappy as might be expected.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p05">How can this possibly be? There are several reasons. For one, people are resilient; they bring their coping skills into play when negative events occur, and this makes them feel better. Second, most people do not continually experience very positive or very negative affect over a long period of time but, rather, adapt to their current circumstances. Just as we enjoy the second chocolate bar we eat less than we enjoy the first, as we experience more and more positive outcomes in our daily lives, we habituate to them and our well-being returns to a more moderate level (Small, Zatorre, Dagher, Evans, &amp; Jones-Gotman, 2001).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_125">Small, D. M., Zatorre, R. J., Dagher, A., Evans, A. C., &amp; Jones-Gotman, M. (2001). Changes in brain activity related to eating chocolate. <em class="emphasis">Brain, 124</em>(9), 1720.</span> Another reason we may predict our happiness incorrectly is that our social comparisons change when our own status changes as a result of new events. People who are wealthy compare themselves to other wealthy people, people who are poor tend to compare themselves with other poor people, and people who are ill tend to compare themselves with other ill people. When our comparisons change, our happiness levels are correspondingly influenced. And when people are asked to predict their future emotions, they may focus only on the positive or negative event they are asked about and forget about all the other things that won’t change. Wilson, Wheatley, Meyers, Gilbert, and Axsom (2000)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_126">Wilson, T. D., Wheatley, T., Meyers, J. M., Gilbert, D. T., &amp; Axsom, D. (2000). Focalism: A source of durability bias in affective forecasting. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78</em>(5), 821–836.</span> found that when people were asked to focus on all the more regular things that they will still be doing in the future (working, going to church, socializing with family and friends, etc.), their predictions about how something really good or bad would influence them were less extreme.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p06">If pleasure is fleeting, at least misery shares some of the same quality. We might think we can’t be happy if something terrible, such as the loss of a partner or child, were to happen to us, but after a period of adjustment, most people find that happiness levels return to prior levels (Bonanno et al., 2002).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_127">Bonanno, G.

And we can also use our emotion regulation skills to help us do better. Even in an age where the addictive and detrimental health effects of cigarette smoking are well understood, more than 60% of children try smoking before they are 18 years old, and more than half who have smoked have tried and failed to quit (Fryar, Merino, Hirsch, &amp; Porter, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_134">Fryar, C.

Exercise keeps us happier, improves fitness, and leads to better health and lower mortality (Fogelholm, 2010; Galper, Trivedi, Barlow, Dunn, &amp; Kampert, 2006; Hassmén, Koivula, &amp; Uutela, 2000).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_135">Fogelholm, M.

About half of U.S. children under 18 report having had intercourse, a rate much higher than in other parts of the world. Although sex is fun, it can also kill us if we are not careful. Sexual activity can lead to guilt about having engaged in the act itself and may also lead to unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection. Alcohol consumption also leads to risky sexual behavior. Sex partners who have been drinking are less likely to practice safe sex and have an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection (Hutton, McCaul, Santora, &amp; Erbelding 2008; Raj et al., 2009).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_142">Hutton, H., McCaul, M., Santora, P., &amp; Erbelding, E.

<span class="title-prefix">3.4</span> Thinking Like a Social Psychologist About Social Affect</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s04_p01">If you have carefully studied this chapter, you will have learned a great deal about how emotions influence our everyday lives and the harmful roles that negative emotions can play. But you will also have learned a great deal about how best to stay happy and healthy. This is not to say that you’ll never be sad or sick—you will—but rather that you will understand how to best cope with these threats. Let’s close this chapter with some thoughts about how a social psychologist, and now you, might think about these topics. I encourage you to practice them—and share them with your friends and family!</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s04_l01">
        <li>Avoid as many negative emotions as you can. Think positively—do something positive for yourself every day.</li>
        <li>Believe that you <em class="emphasis">can</em> make a difference, but don’t exaggerate your ability to do so.</li>
        <li>Be aware of your stress level and work to reduce it through relaxation or other techniques if you can.</li>
        <li>Set realistic goals that you believe you can attain, and carefully regulate your emotions and behaviors as you try to reach them.</li>
        <li>Practice healthy behaviors, including aerobic exercise. People who exercise regularly may live 1 to 2 years longer than those who don’t (Paffenbarger, Hyde, Wing, &amp; Hsieh, 1986).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn03_145">Paffenbarger, R.

</li>
        <li>Avoid unhealthy activities such as smoking, drinking excessively, and unsafe sex.</li>
        <li>Develop close relationships with others, and if you can, share your problems with them.</li>
        <li>Realize—really!—that money cannot buy happiness.</li>

<span class="title-prefix">3.5</span> Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s05_p01">Affect, the A within social psychology’s ABCs, refers to the feelings we experience as part of our everyday lives. Although affect can be harmful when it gets out of control, our affective experiences normally help us to function efficiently and in a way that increases our chances of survival. Although affect is involved in many aspects of our life, it is particularly social—our emotions provide us with information about our relationships with others.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s05_p02">One component of affect is mood—the positive or negative feelings that are in the background of our everyday experiences. Emotions are affective states like moods, but they are shorter lived, stronger, more intense, and more specific forms of affect. There are both basic emotions, which are communicated through culturally shared facial expressions, and secondary emotions—those that provide us with more complex feelings about our social worlds.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s05_p03">Emotions have both a biological and a cognitive aspect. The biological component of emotions is arousal, which is created by the parasympathetic nervous system and regulated by the limbic system and the amygdala. The cognitive component is the label we place on the arousal. There are some gender and cultural differences in the experience of emotion.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s05_p04">When people incorrectly label the source of the arousal that they are experiencing, we say that they have misattributed their arousal. Misattributing arousal may make it difficult for us to determine what emotion we are experiencing.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s05_p05">One outcome of threatening life experiences is stress—the physical and psychological reactions that occur whenever we believe that the demands of the situation threaten our ability to respond to the threat. Extreme events and just everyday hassles can create stress. The experience of prolonged stress has a direct influence on our immune system, leaving us more susceptible to a variety of health problems. Stress influences our behavior through its effects on the HPA axis and the secretion of stress hormones, including cortisol.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s05_p06">Depression is an affective disorder in which people experience sadness, low self-esteem, negative thoughts, pessimism, and apathy. Anxiety is an affective disorder that may be accompanied by a number of physical symptoms, including diarrhea, upset stomach, sweaty hands, and shortness of breath. Anxiety and depression are partially genetically inherited but are influenced by our social interactions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s05_p07">The attitude that we express toward our life in general is known as well-being. In general, people feel positive about themselves, but there are many potential threats to the self-concept, and we must learn to effectively cope with them.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s05_p08">Research has found that there are clear difficulties with an approach to negative events and feelings that involves simply trying to ignore them—suppressing our emotions is not a very good option, at least in the long run, because it tends to fail. Rather, when we are faced with troubles, it is healthy to let the negative thoughts and feelings out by expressing them, either to ourselves or to others, and by practicing effective self-regulation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s05_p09">In general, we can say that we will feel good about ourselves when we have successfully met the goals of creating adequate social support—the development of positive social connections with others. Happiness does not come through money and material wealth.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s05_p10">Social psychologists have investigated the ability of human beings to predict their future emotional states and found that they are not very accurate in this regard. Although positive and negative life changes do make at least some difference in well-being, they tend to be less influential than we think they are going to be.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch03_s05_p11">Your new understanding of the role of affect in social judgment and in mental and physical health, and particularly your understanding of the importance of self-regulation, can help you respond more effectively to the negative situations that you experience.</p>
