    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_p01">We have seen that we use personality traits to help us understand and communicate about the people we know. But how do we know what traits people have? People don’t walk around with labels saying “I am generous” or “I am aggressive” on their foreheads. In some cases, we may learn about a person indirectly, for instance, through the comments that other people make about that person. We also use the techniques of person perception to help us learn about people and their traits by observing them and interpreting their behaviors. If Frank hits Joe, we might conclude that Frank is aggressive. If Leslie leaves a big tip for the waitress, we might conclude that Leslie is generous. It seems natural and reasonable to make such inferences because we can assume (often, but not always, correctly) that behavior is caused by personality. It is Frank’s aggressiveness that causes him to hit, and it is Leslie’s generosity that led to her big tip.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_p02">Although we can sometimes infer personality by observing behavior, this is not always the case. Remember that behavior is influenced by both our personal characteristics and the social context in which we find ourselves. What this means is that the behavior we observe other people engaging in might not always be that reflective of their personality—the behavior might have been caused by the situation rather than by underlying person characteristics. Perhaps Frank hit Joe not because he is really an aggressive person but because Joe insulted or provoked him first. And perhaps Leslie left a big tip in order to impress her friends rather than because she is truly generous.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_p03">Because behavior is determined by both the person and the situation, we must attempt to determine which of these two causes actually determined the behavior. <em class="emphasis">The process of trying to determine the causes of people’s behavior</em> is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">causal attribution</a><span class="glossdef">The process of trying to determine the causes of other people’s behavior.</span></span> (Heider, 1958).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_061">Heider, F. (1958). <em class="emphasis">The psychology of interpersonal relations</em>. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.</span> Because we cannot see personality, we must work to infer it. When a couple we know breaks up, despite what seemed to be a match made in heaven, we are naturally curious. What could have caused the breakup? Was it something one of them said or did? Or perhaps stress from financial hardship was the culprit?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_p04">Making a causal attribution is a bit like conducting a social psychology experiment. We carefully observe the people we are interested in, and we note how they behave in different social situations. After we have made our observations, we draw our conclusions. We make a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">personal (or internal or dispositional) attribution</a><span class="glossdef">The determination that a behavior was caused primarily by the personality characteristics of the individual.</span></span> <em class="emphasis">when we decide that the behavior was caused primarily by the person</em>. A personal attribution might be something like “I think they broke up because Sarah was not committed to the relationship.” At other times, <em class="emphasis">we may determine that the behavior was caused primarily by the situation</em>—we call this making a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">situational (or external) attribution</a><span class="glossdef">The determination that a behavior was caused primarily by factors external to the person.</span></span>. A situational attribution might be something like “I think they broke up because they were under such financial stress.” At yet other times, we may decide that the behavior was caused by both the person and the situation.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Making Inferences About Personality</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p01">It is easier to make personal attributions in some cases than in others. When a behavior is unusual or unexpected, we can more easily make a personal attribution for it. Imagine that you go to a party and you are introduced to Tess. Tess shakes your hand and says, “Nice to meet you!” Can you readily conclude, on the basis of this behavior, that Tess is a friendly person? Probably not. Because the social context demands that people act in a friendly way (by shaking your hand and saying “Nice to meet you”), it is difficult to know whether Tess acted friendly because of the situation or because she is really friendly. Imagine, however, that instead of shaking your hand, Tess sticks her tongue out at you and walks away. I think you would agree that it is easier in this case to infer that Tess is unfriendly because her behavior is so contrary to what one would expect.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p02">To test this idea, Edward Jones and his colleagues (Jones, Davis, &amp; Gergen, 1961)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_062">Jones, E. E., Davis, K. E., &amp; Gergen, K. J. (1961). Role playing variations and their informational value for person perception. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 63</em>(2), 302–310.</span> conducted an experiment in which participants viewed one of four different videotapes of a man who was applying for a job. For half the participants, the video they viewed indicated that the man was interviewing for a job as a submariner, a position that required close contact with many people over a long period of time. It was clear to the man being interviewed, as well as to the research participants, that to be a good submariner you should be extroverted (i.e., you should enjoy being around others). The other half of the participants saw a video in which the man was interviewing for a job as an astronaut, which involved (remember, this study was conducted in 1961) being in a small capsule, alone, for days on end. In this case, it was clear to everyone that in order to be good astronaut, you should have an introverted personality.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p03">During the videotape of the interview, a second variable was also manipulated. One half of the participants saw the man indicate that he was actually an introvert (he said things such as “I like to work on my own,” “I don’t go out much”), and the other half saw the man say that he was actually an extrovert (he said things such as “I would like to be a salesman,” “I always get ideas from others”). After viewing one of the four videotapes, participants were asked to indicate how introverted or extroverted they thought the applicant really was.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p04">As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_t01">Table 6.2 "Attributions to Expected and Unexpected Behaviors"</a>, when the applicant gave responses that better matched what was required by the job (i.e., for the submariner job, the applicant said he was an extrovert, and for the astronaut job, he said he was an introvert), the participants did not think his statements were as indicative of his underlying personality as they did when the applicant said the opposite of what was expected by the job (i.e., when the job required that he be extroverted but he said he was introverted, or vice versa).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p06">The idea here is that the statements that were unusual or unexpected (on the basis of the job requirements) just seemed like they could not possibly have been caused by the situation, so the participants really thought that the interviewee was telling the truth. On the other hand, when the interviewees made statements that were consistent with what was required by the situation, it was more difficult to be sure that he was telling the truth (perhaps he was just saying these things because he wanted to get the job), and the participants made weaker personal attributions for his behavior.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p07">We can also make personal attributions more easily when we know that the person had a choice in the behavior. If a person chooses to be friendly, even in situations in which he might not be, this probably means that he is friendly. But if we can determine that he’s been forced to be friendly, it’s more difficult to know. I’m sure you would agree that if you saw a man pointing a gun at another person, and then you saw that person give his watch and wallet to the gunman, you would not infer that the person was generous!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p08">Jones and Harris (1967)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_064">Jones, E. E., &amp; Harris, V. A. (1967). The attribution of attitudes. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 3</em>(1), 1–24.</span> had student participants in a study read essays that had been written by other students. Half of the participants thought that the students had chosen the essay topics, whereas the other half thought that the students had been assigned the topics by their professor. The participants were more likely to make a personal attribution that the students really believed in the essay they were writing when they had chosen the topics rather than been assigned topics.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p09">Sometimes a person may try to lead others to make personal attributions for their behavior to make themselves seem more believable to those others. For example, when a politician makes statements supporting a cause in front of an audience that does not agree with her position, the politician will be seen as more committed to her beliefs, and may be more persuasive, than if she gave the same argument in front of an audience known to support her views. Again, the idea is based on principles of attribution—if there is an obvious situational reason for making a statement (the audience supports the politician’s views), then the personal attribution (that the politician really believes what she is saying) is harder to make.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Detecting the Covariation Between Personality and Behavior</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_p01">So far, we have considered how we make personal attributions when we have only limited information, that is, behavior observed at only a single point in time—a woman leaving a big tip at a restaurant, a man answering questions at a job interview, or a politician giving a speech. But the process of making attributions also occurs when we are able to observe a person’s behavior in more than one situation. Certainly, we can learn more about Leslie’s generosity if she gives a big tip in many different restaurants with many different people, and we can learn more about a politician’s beliefs by observing the kinds of speeches she gives to different audiences over time.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_p02">When people have multiple sources of information about the behavior of a person, they can make attributions by assessing the relationship between a person’s behavior and the social context in which it occurs. One way of doing so is to use the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">covariation principle</a><span class="glossdef">The principle that when making causal attributions, a behavior is seen to more likely have been caused by the situation if that behavior systematically changes across situations.</span></span>, which states that a given <em class="emphasis">behavior is more likely to have been caused by the situation if that behavior covaries (or changes) across situations.</em> Our job, then, is to study the patterns of a person’s behavior across different situations in order to help us to draw inferences about the causes of that behavior (Jones et al., 1987; Kelley, 1967).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_065">Jones, E.

        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_p04">Imagine that your friend Jane likes to go out with a lot of different guys, and you have observed her behavior with each of these guys over time. One night she goes to a party with Jimmy, where you observe something unusual. Although Jane has come to the party with Jimmy, she completely ignores him all night. She dances with some other guys, and in the end she leaves the party with someone else. This is the kind of situation that might make you wonder about the cause of Jane’s behavior (is she a rude person, or is this behavior caused more by Jimmy?) and for which you might use the covariation principle to attempt to draw some conclusions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_p05">According to the covariation principle, you should be able to determine the cause of Jane’s behavior by considering the three types of covariation information: consistency, distinctiveness, and consensus. One question you might ask is whether Jane always treats Jimmy this way when she goes out with him. If the answer is yes, then you have some <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">consistency information</a><span class="glossdef">The perception that a situation always produces the same behavior in a person. When we perceive consistency information, we are likely to make an attribution to the situation.</span></span>—the situation (Jimmy’s presence) always produces the same behavior in Jane. If you have noticed that Jane ignores Jimmy more than she ignores the other men she dates, then you also have <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">distinctiveness information</a><span class="glossdef">The perception that a behavior occurs when the situation is present but not when it is not present. When we perceive distinctiveness information, we are likely to make an attribution to the situation.</span></span>—the behavior is occurring only (or at least more often or more strongly) when the social situation (Jimmy) is present. Finally, you might look for <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">consensus information</a><span class="glossdef">The perception that a situation is creating the same response in most people. When we perceive consensus information, we are likely to make an attribution to the situation.</span></span> too—if the other women Jimmy goes out with also treat him this way, then it seems, again, as if it’s Jimmy who is causing the behavior.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_p06">Consider one more example. Imagine that a friend of yours tells you that he has just seen a new movie and that it is the greatest movie he’s ever seen. As you wonder whether you should make an attribution to the situation (the movie), you will naturally ask about consensus—do other people like the movie too? If they do, then you have positive consensus information about how good the movie is. But you probably also have some information about your friend’s experiences with movies over time. If you are like me, you probably have friends who love every movie they see; if this is the case for this friend, you probably won’t yet be that convinced that it’s a great movie—in this case, your friend’s reactions would not be distinctive. On the other hand, if your friend does not like of most movies he sees but loves this one, then distinctiveness is strong (the behavior is occurring only in this particular situation). If this is the case, then you can be more certain it’s something about the movie that has caused your friend’s enthusiasm. Your next thought may be, “I’m going to see that movie tonight.” You can see still another example of the use of covariation information in <a class="xref" href="#stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_t01">Table 6.3 "Using Covariation Information"</a>.</p>

Think back for a moment to a test that you took, or perhaps about another task that you performed, and consider why you did either well or poorly on it. Then see if your thoughts reflect what Bernard Weiner (1985)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_067">Weiner, B. (1985). Attributional theory of achievement motivation and emotion. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Review, 92</em>, 548–573.</span> considered to be the important factors in this regard.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p02">Weiner was interested in how we determine the causes of success or failure because he felt that this information was particularly important for us: Accurately determining why we have succeeded or failed will help us see which tasks we are at good at already and which we need to work on in order to improve. Weiner also proposed that we make these determinations by engaging in causal attribution and that the outcomes of our decision-making process were made either to the person (“I succeeded/failed because of my own person characteristics”) or to the situation (“I succeeded/failed because of something about the situation”).</p>

However, he also argued that those personal and situational causes could be either stable (less likely to change over time) or unstable (more likely to change over time).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p04">If you did well on a test because you are really smart, then this is a personal and stable attribution of <em class="emphasis">ability</em>. It’s clearly something that is caused by you personally, and it is also a stable cause—you are smart today, and you’ll probably be smart in the future. However, if you succeeded more because you studied hard, then this is a success due to <em class="emphasis">motivation</em>. It is again personal (you studied), but it is also unstable (although you studied really hard for this test, you might not work so hard for the next one). Weiner considered <em class="emphasis">task difficulty</em> to be a situational cause—you may have succeeded on the test because it was easy, and he assumed that the next test would probably be easy for you too (i.e., that the task, whatever it is, is always either hard or easy). Finally, Weiner considered success due to <em class="emphasis">luck</em> (you just guessed a lot of the answers correctly) to be a situational cause, but one that was more unstable than task difficulty.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p05">It turns out that although Weiner’s attributions do not always fit perfectly (e.g., task difficulty may sometimes change over time and thus be at least somewhat unstable), the four types of information pretty well capture the types of attributions that people make for success and failure.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s02_p01">We have seen that person perception is useful in helping us successfully interact with others. If we can figure out why our roommate is angry at us, we can respond appropriately to resolve the problem; and if we can determine why we did so poorly on the last psychology test, we can try to prepare differently so we do better on the next test. Because successful navigation of the social world is based on being accurate, we can expect that our attributional skills will be pretty good. However, although people are reasonably accurate in their attributions—we could say, perhaps, that they are “good enough” (Fiske, 2003)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_068">Fiske, S. T. (2003). <em class="emphasis">Social beings</em>. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons.</span>—they are far from perfect. In fact (and I doubt this is going to surprise you), causal attributions are subject to the same types of biases that any other types of social judgments are.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s03_p01">One way that our attributions are biased is that we are often too quick to attribute the behavior of other people to something personal about them rather than to something about their situation. This is a classic example of the general human tendency of underestimating how important the social situation really is in determining behavior. This bias occurs in two ways. First, we are too likely to make strong personal attributions to account for the behavior that we observe others engaging in. That is, we are more likely to say “Leslie left a big tip, so she must be generous” than “Leslie left a big tip, but perhaps that was because she was trying to impress her friends.” Second, we also tend to make more personal attributions about the behavior of others (we tend to say “Leslie is a generous person”) than we do for ourselves (we tend to say “I am generous in some situations but not in others”). Let’s consider each of these biases (the <em class="emphasis">fundamental attribution error</em> and the <em class="emphasis">actor-observer difference</em>) in turn.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s03_p02">When we explain the behavior of others, <em class="emphasis">we tend to overestimate the role of person factors and overlook the impact of situations</em>. In fact, the tendency to do so is so common that it is known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fundamental attribution error (correspondence bias)</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency when explaining the behavior of others to overestimate the role of personal factors and overlook the impact of situations.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s03_p03">In one demonstration of the fundamental attribution error, Linda Skitka and her colleagues (Skitka, Mullen, Griffin, Hutchinson, &amp; Chamberlin, 2002)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_069">Skitka, L.

The students were described as having been randomly assigned to the role of a quizmaster or of a contestant by drawing straws. The quizmaster was asked to generate five questions from his idiosyncratic knowledge, with the stipulation that he knew the correct answer to all five questions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s03_p04">Joe (the quizmaster) subsequently posed his questions to the other student (Stan, the contestant). For example, Joe asked, “What cowboy movie actor’s sidekick is Smiley Burnette?” Stan looked puzzled and finally replied, “I really don’t know. The only movie cowboy that pops to mind for me is John Wayne.” Joe asked four additional questions, and Stan was described as answering only one of the five questions correctly. After reading the story, the students were asked to indicate their impression of both Stan’s and Joe’s intelligence.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s03_p05">If you think about the setup here, you’ll notice that the professor has created a situation that can have a big influence on the outcomes. Joe, the quizmaster, has a huge advantage because he got to choose the questions. As a result, the questions are hard for the contestant to answer. But did the participants realize that the situation was the cause of the outcomes? They did not. Rather, the students rated Joe as significantly more intelligent than Stan. You can imagine that Joe just seemed to be really smart to the students; after all, he knew all the answers, whereas Stan knew only one of the five. But of course this is a mistake. The difference was not at all due to person factors but completely to the situation—Joe got to use his own personal store of esoteric knowledge to create the most difficult questions he could think of. The observers committed the fundamental attribution error and did not sufficiently take the quizmaster’s situational advantage into account.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s03_p06">The fundamental attribution error involves a bias in how easily and frequently we make personal versus situational attributions to others.

On the other hand, when we think of ourselves, we are more likely to take the situation into account—we tend to say, “Well, I’m shy in my psychology discussion class, but with my baseball friends I’m not at all shy.” When our friend behaves in a helpful way, we naturally believe that she is a friendly person; when we behave in the same way, on the other hand, we realize that there may be a lot of other reasons why we did what we did.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s03_p07">You might be able to get a feel for the actor-observer difference by taking the following short quiz. First, think about a person you know—your mom, your roommate, or someone from one of your classes. Then, for each row, circle which of the three choices best describes his or her personality (for instance, is the person’s personality more energetic, relaxed, or does it depend on the situation?). Then answer the questions again, but this time about yourself.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s03_p10">Like the fundamental attribution error, the actor-observer difference reflects our tendency to overweight the personal explanations of the behavior of other people. However, a recent meta-analysis (Malle, 2006)<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_073">Malle, B. F. (2006). The actor-observer asymmetry in attribution: A (surprising) meta-analysis. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 132</em>(6), 895–919.</span> has suggested that the actor-observer difference might not be as strong as the fundamental attribution error is and may only be likely to occur for some people.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s03_p11">The tendency to overemphasize personal attributions seems to occur for several reasons. One reason is simply because other people are so salient in our social environments. When I look at you, I see you as my focus, and so I am likely to make personal attributions about you. It’s just easy because I am looking right at you. When I look at Leslie giving that big tip, I see her—and so I decide that it is she who caused the action. When I think of my own behavior, however, I do not see myself but am instead more focused on my situation. I realize that it is not only me but also the different situations that I am in that determine my behavior. I can remember the other times that I didn’t give a big tip, and so I conclude that my behavior is caused more by the situation than by my underlying personality. In fact, research has shown that we tend to make more personal attributions for the people we are directly observing in our environments than for other people who are part of the situation but who we are not directly watching (Taylor &amp; Fiske, 1975).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_074">Taylor, S. E., &amp; Fiske, S. T. (1975). Point of view and perceptions of causality. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 32</em>(3), 439–445.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s03_p12">A second reason for the tendency to make so many personal attributions is that they are simply easier to make than situational attributions. In fact, personal attributions seem to be made spontaneously, without any effort on our part, and even on the basis of only very limited behavior (Newman &amp; Uleman, 1989; Uleman, Blader, &amp; Todorov, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_075">Newman, L.

New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</span> Personal attributions just pop into mind before situational attributions do.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s03_p13">Third, personal attributions also dominate because we need to make them in order to understand a situation. That is, we cannot make either a personal attribution (e.g., “Leslie is generous”) or a situational attribution (“Leslie is trying to impress her friends”) until we have first identified the behavior as being a generous behavior (“Leaving that big tip was a generous thing to do”). So we end up starting with the personal attribution (“generous”) and only later try to correct or adjust our judgment (“Oh,” we think, “perhaps it really was the situation that caused her to do that”).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s03_p14">Adjusting our judgments generally takes more effort than making the original judgment does, and the adjustment is frequently not sufficient. We are more likely to commit the fundamental attribution error—quickly jumping to the conclusion that behavior is caused by underlying personality—when we are tired, distracted, or busy doing other things (Geeraert, Yzerbyt, Corneille, &amp; Wigboldus, 2004; Gilbert, 1989; Trope &amp; Alfieri, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_076">Geeraert, N., Yzerbyt, V.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s03_p15">I hope you might have noticed that there is an important moral about perceiving others that applies here: <em class="emphasis">We should not be too quick to judge other people!</em> It is easy to think that poor people are lazy, that people who harm someone else are mean, and that people who say something harsh are rude or unfriendly. But these attributions may frequently overemphasize the role of the person. This can sometimes result in overly harsh evaluations of people who don’t really deserve them—we tend to <em class="emphasis">blame the victim</em>, even for events that they can’t really control (Lerner, 1980).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_077">Lerner, M. J. (1980). <em class="emphasis">The belief in a just world: A fundamental delusion</em>. New York, NY: Plenum.</span> Sometimes people are lazy, mean, or rude, but they may also be the victims of situations. When you find yourself making strong personal attribution for the behaviors of others, your experience as a social psychologist should lead you to stop and think more carefully: Would you want other people to make personal attributions for your behavior in the same situation, or would you prefer that they more fully consider the situation surrounding your behavior? Are you perhaps making the fundamental attribution error?</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s04_p01">You may recall that the process of making causal attributions is supposed to proceed in a careful, rational, and even scientific manner. But this assumption turns out to be, at least in part, untrue. Our attributions are sometimes biased by affect—particularly the fundamental desire to enhance the self. Although we would like to think that we are always rational and accurate in our attributions, we often tend to distort them to make us feel better. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Self-serving attributions</a><span class="glossdef">Attributions that help us meet our desires to see ourselves positively.</span></span> are <em class="emphasis">attributions that help us meet our desires to see ourselves positively</em> (Mezulis, Abramson, Hyde, &amp; Hankin, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="stangorsocial_1.0-fn06_078">Mezulis, A.

            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s04_p02">I have noticed that I sometimes make self-enhancing attributions. If my students do well on one of my exams, I make a personal attribution for their successes (“I am, after all, a great teacher!”). On the other hand, when my students do poorly on an exam, I tend to make a situational attribution—I blame them for their failure (“Why didn’t you guys study harder?”). You can see that this process is clearly not the type of scientific, rational, and careful process that attribution theory suggests I should be following. It’s unfair, although it does make me feel better about myself. If I were really acting like a scientist, however, I would determine ahead of time what causes good or poor exam scores and make the appropriate attribution regardless of the outcome.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="stangorsocial_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_s04_p03">You might have noticed yourself making self-serving attributions too. Perhaps you have blamed another driver for an accident that you were in or blamed your partner rather than yourself for a breakup. Or perhaps you have taken credit (internal) for your successes but blamed your failures on external causes. If these judgments were somewhat less than accurate, even though they did benefit you, then they are indeed self-serving.</p>

                    <li>Causal attribution is the process of trying to determine the causes of people’s behavior.</li>
                    <li>Attributions are made to personal or situational causes.</li>
                    <li>It is easier to make personal attributions when a behavior is unusual or unexpected and when people are perceived to have chosen to engage in it.</li>
                    <li>The covariation principle proposes that we use consistency information, distinctiveness information, and consensus information to draw inferences about the causes of behaviors.</li>
                    <li>According to Bernard Weiner, success or failure can be seen as coming from either personal causes (ability and motivation) or situational causes (luck and task difficulty).</li>
                    <li>Our attributional skills are “good enough” but not perfect. Examples of errors in causal attribution are the fundamental attribution error, the actor-observer difference, and the tendency to make self-serving attributions.</li>

                    <li>Describe a time when you used causal attribution to make an inference about another person’s personality. What was the outcome of the attributional process? Do you think the attribution was accurate?</li>
                    <li>Consider a time when you made an attribution about your own success or failure. How did your analysis of the situation relate to Weiner’s ideas about these processes?</li>
                    <li>Describe a time when you or someone you know engaged in the fundamental attribution error, the actor-observer difference, or a self-serving attribution. What was the outcome of the error for yourself or for the other person?</li>
